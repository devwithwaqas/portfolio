# One-Page Resume Best Practices & ATS Guidelines

## ✅ DO's for One-Page Resumes

### Formatting & Structure
- **Font Size:** Use 11-12pt body text (not smaller than 10pt)
- **Section Headings:** 14-16pt for section titles
- **Margins:** 0.75" to 1" on all sides (0.5" is too tight)
- **Layout:** Single-column layout ONLY (no two-column layouts for ATS compatibility)
- **Fonts:** Standard fonts only (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, Verdana, Georgia)
- **Consistency:** Use consistent formatting throughout

### Content Strategy
- **Top 3-4 Experiences:** Only include most recent and relevant positions
- **Professional Summary:** Keep concise but keyword-rich (3-4 lines max)
- **Skills:** List in simple format, not complex grids
- **Education:** One line format
- **Awards:** Either remove or make extremely brief (one line)
- **Keywords:** Naturally integrate keywords from job description
- **Bullet Points:** 2-3 bullets per experience, focus on achievements with metrics

### ATS Optimization
- **Standard Sections:** Work Experience, Education, Skills, Certifications
- **No Tables/Columns:** Avoid multi-column layouts
- **No Graphics:** No images, logos, charts, or special symbols
- **Plain Text:** Ensure all text is selectable (not images)
- **File Format:** Save as .docx or ATS-safe PDF

## ❌ DON'Ts for One-Page Resumes

### Formatting Mistakes
- ❌ Don't use two-column layouts (ATS can't parse properly)
- ❌ Don't use tables, text boxes, or sidebars
- ❌ Don't use fonts smaller than 10pt
- ❌ Don't use fancy fonts (Comic Sans, Courier, script fonts)
- ❌ Don't place contact info in headers/footers
- ❌ Don't use special symbols (☑, ➤, ★, emojis)
- ❌ Don't use underlining (use bold sparingly for headers only)

### Content Mistakes
- ❌ Don't include all work experience (only top 3-4)
- ❌ Don't keyword stuff (use keywords naturally)
- ❌ Don't include irrelevant information
- ❌ Don't make text too small to fit everything
- ❌ Don't use complex skill grids (simple lists work better)

## 📊 One-Page Resume Structure

1. **Header** (Contact Info)
   - Name, Title
   - Email, Phone, Location
   - LinkedIn, GitHub, Website
   - Link to full resume on portfolio

2. **Professional Summary** (3-4 lines)
   - Years of experience
   - Key specializations
   - Top achievements (with metrics)
   - Keywords naturally integrated

3. **Professional Experience** (Top 3-4 positions only)
   - Most recent role: 3-4 bullets with metrics
   - Previous roles: 2-3 bullets each
   - Focus on achievements, not duties
   - Use action verbs and quantify results

4. **Technical Skills** (Simple list format)
   - Group by category
   - Single-column list
   - No complex grids

5. **Education** (One line)
   - Degree, University, Year

6. **Optional: Awards** (One line only if space allows)
   - Most prestigious award only

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **Quality over Quantity:** Better to have 3-4 strong experiences than 8 weak ones
2. **Metrics Matter:** Every bullet should have a number/percentage/impact
3. **ATS First:** If ATS can't read it, humans won't see it
4. **Readability:** Text must be readable (11pt minimum)
5. **One Page Means One Page:** If it spills to page 2, cut content, don't shrink text

## 🔗 Portfolio Link Strategy

Include a link to the full resume section:
- Format: "View full resume: [portfolio-url]#resume"
- Place in header or footer
- Use standard hyperlink format (ATS can parse)
- Example: "Full resume: https://waqasahmad-portfolio.web.app/#resume"

## 📏 Font Size Guidelines

- **Name/Title:** 18-20pt
- **Section Headings:** 14-16pt
- **Body Text:** 11-12pt (minimum 10pt)
- **Contact Info:** 9-10pt
- **Keywords:** 9-10pt (can be smaller)
