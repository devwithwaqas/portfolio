  content: `## Introduction

This guidance is relevant when the topic of this article applies to your system or design choices; it breaks down when constraints or context differ. I've applied it in real projects and refined the takeaways over time (as of 2026).

**Design patterns** are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are not code to copy-paste but **templates** for structuring code and communication. This article gives an **overview** of the three main categories—[Creational](#creational-in-depth-overview), [Structural](#structural-in-depth-overview), and [Behavioral](#behavioral-in-depth-overview)—with a clear hierarchy, when to use which, and how they fit together. For **full code**, **class diagrams**, and **use cases** for each pattern, see the dedicated articles: [Creational in .NET](/blog/creational-design-patterns-dotnet), [Structural in .NET](/blog/structural-design-patterns-dotnet), [Behavioral in .NET](/blog/behavioral-design-patterns-dotnet).

## Decision Context

- **System scale:** Varies by context; the approach in this article applies to the scales and scenarios described in the body.
- **Team size:** Typically small to medium teams; ownership and clarity matter more than headcount.
- **Time / budget pressure:** Applicable under delivery pressure; I've used it in both greenfield and incremental refactors.
- **Technical constraints:** .NET and related stack where relevant; constraints are noted in the article where they affect the approach.
- **Non-goals:** This article does not optimize for every possible scenario; boundaries are stated where they matter.


## What are design patterns and why they matter

**Design patterns** are **recurring solutions** to recurring design problems. They come from the **Gang of Four** (GoF) book and are grouped into **Creational** (how objects are created), **Structural** (how objects are composed), and **Behavioral** (how objects interact and share responsibility). They are not libraries or frameworks—they are **templates** that you apply in your code to improve flexibility, maintainability, and communication between developers.

**Why they matter:** Using patterns helps you **avoid reinventing the wheel**, **name** common designs so teams can discuss them quickly, and **keep code** decoupled and testable. Overusing patterns or forcing them where a simple solution suffices can make code harder to read; use them when they **simplify** the design and match the problem.

## Creational in depth (overview)

**Creational patterns** deal with **how objects are created**: deferring creation to a method or subclass (Factory Method), to a family of factories (Abstract Factory), to a step-by-step builder (Builder), by cloning (Prototype), or by ensuring a single instance (Singleton). They help **decouple** client code from concrete types and creation logic.

For **all five** creational patterns with **class diagrams**, **when to use each**, and **full C# examples**, see the dedicated article: [Creational Design Patterns in .NET](/blog/creational-design-patterns-dotnet).

---

## Structural in depth (overview)

**Structural patterns** deal with **how objects are composed** into larger structures: wrapping one interface to match another (Adapter), separating abstraction from implementation (Bridge), treating trees uniformly (Composite), adding behavior dynamically (Decorator), simplifying a subsystem (Facade), sharing state to save memory (Flyweight), and providing a placeholder or access control (Proxy).

For **all seven** structural patterns with **class diagrams**, **when to use each**, and **full C# examples**, see the dedicated article: [Structural Design Patterns in .NET](/blog/structural-design-patterns-dotnet).

---

## Behavioral in depth (overview)

**Behavioral patterns** deal with **how objects interact** and distribute responsibility: notifying observers (Observer), switching algorithms at runtime (Strategy), encapsulating requests (Command), modeling state-dependent behavior (State), defining a skeleton algorithm (Template Method), passing requests along a chain (Chain of Responsibility), and others (Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Interpreter, Visitor).

For **all eleven** behavioral patterns with **class diagrams**, **when to use each**, and **full C# examples**, see the dedicated article: [Behavioral Design Patterns in .NET](/blog/behavioral-design-patterns-dotnet).

## Comparison: Creational vs Structural vs Behavioral

| Category | Focus | When to use | Example patterns |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Creational** | How objects are created | Decouple creation, reuse instances, abstract construction | Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Singleton |
| **Structural** | How objects are composed | Build larger structures, wrap/adapt, simplify interfaces | Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy |
| **Behavioral** | How objects interact | Distribute responsibility, notify, switch algorithms | Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Template Method, Chain of Responsibility |

---

## When to use which category

- **Creational:** Use when the **creation** of objects is complex, varies by context, or you need to control instantiation (e.g. Factory for different document types, Builder for optional parameters, Singleton for a single shared instance).
- **Structural:** Use when you need to **compose** or **wrap** types: adapt an existing interface (Adapter), add behavior without subclassing (Decorator), hide a complex subsystem (Facade), or control access (Proxy).
- **Behavioral:** Use when **communication** or **flow of control** is the concern: one object notifies many (Observer), you want to swap algorithms (Strategy), encapsulate a request (Command), or model state-dependent behavior (State).

---

## Where patterns live in a .NET solution

In a **typical .NET solution** that applies design patterns, interfaces and concrete types are grouped by feature or layer; patterns are reflected in **how** types depend on each other, not necessarily in folder names. Creational patterns appear in **factories** and **builders** (often in Composition/DI); Structural in **adapters**, **decorators**, **facades** (often in Infrastructure); Behavioral in **handlers**, **strategies**, **state** classes (often in Core or Application).

\`\`\`
MyApp.sln
  src/MyApp/
    Core/                    # Interfaces, domain (Strategy, Command, State)
    Infrastructure/          # Adapters, external APIs (Adapter, Proxy)
    Application/             # Use cases, orchestration (Facade, Template Method)
    Composition/             # DI registration (Factory, Builder, Singleton via DI)
\`\`\`

**How they interact:** \`Core\` defines interfaces (e.g. \`IDocument\`, \`IDiscountStrategy\`). \`Infrastructure\` implements adapters and proxies. \`Application\` uses facades and template methods to orchestrate. \`Composition\` (e.g. \`Program.cs\` or a DI module) wires factories and singletons. For **full code** and **class diagrams** for each pattern, see [Creational in .NET](/blog/creational-design-patterns-dotnet), [Structural in .NET](/blog/structural-design-patterns-dotnet), [Behavioral in .NET](/blog/behavioral-design-patterns-dotnet).

---

## Quick code examples (one per category)

**Creational (Factory Method in C#):** A base class defines a factory method; subclasses create the concrete product. The client depends on the abstraction, not the concrete type.

\`\`\`csharp
public abstract class DocumentProcessor {
    public void Process() {
        var doc = CreateDocument();
        doc.Load();
        doc.Transform();
    }
    protected abstract IDocument CreateDocument();
}
public class PdfProcessor : DocumentProcessor {
    protected override IDocument CreateDocument() => new PdfDocument();
}
\`\`\`

**Structural (Decorator in C#):** Wrap a component to add behaviour without changing its interface. Each decorator holds a reference to the inner component and delegates, then adds its own logic.

\`\`\`csharp
public interface IOrderService { Task<Order> GetByIdAsync(string id); }
public class LoggingOrderService : IOrderService {
    private readonly IOrderService _inner;
    public LoggingOrderService(IOrderService inner) => _inner = inner;
    public async Task<Order> GetByIdAsync(string id) {
        Console.WriteLine("GetOrder " + id);
        return await _inner.GetByIdAsync(id);
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Behavioral (Strategy in C#):** Inject an algorithm so the same context can use different strategies at runtime. The context calls the strategy interface; tests and production can swap implementations.

\`\`\`csharp
public interface IDiscountStrategy { decimal Apply(decimal amount); }
public class OrderCalculator {
    private readonly IDiscountStrategy _strategy;
    public OrderCalculator(IDiscountStrategy strategy) => _strategy = strategy;
    public decimal Total(decimal subtotal) => _strategy.Apply(subtotal);
}
// Register in DI: AddScoped<IDiscountStrategy, PercentDiscountStrategy>()
\`\`\`

For **every pattern** with full C# examples and class diagrams, see the dedicated articles: [Creational](/blog/creational-design-patterns-dotnet), [Structural](/blog/structural-design-patterns-dotnet), [Behavioral](/blog/behavioral-design-patterns-dotnet).

---

## Best practices and pitfalls

**Overusing patterns:** Not every class needs a pattern. Use patterns when they **simplify** design and communication; avoid pattern-heavy code that is harder to read.

**Misusing Singleton:** Singleton can make testing and concurrency hard. Prefer **dependency injection** and a single registered instance (e.g. \`AddSingleton<T>\`) so tests can replace it.

**Confusing similar patterns:** Factory vs Abstract Factory (one product vs family), Strategy vs State (algorithm vs state transitions), Decorator vs Adapter (add behaviour vs change interface)—pick the one that **matches the problem**.

**Where patterns fit:** In [Clean Architecture](/blog/clean-architecture-dotnet), Creational patterns live in composition/DI; Structural in adapters and infrastructure; Behavioral in use cases and domain.

---
---

## Position & Rationale

I use patterns when they **match a recurring problem** and make the design clearer—not when they're a goal in themselves. I favour **Creational** (Factory, Builder, DI) for construction, **Structural** (Adapter, Decorator, Facade) for composition and wrapping, **Behavioral** (Strategy, Observer, Command, State) for interaction and flow. I avoid applying every pattern everywhere; a simple conditional or delegate often suffices. I also avoid memorising the catalog without understanding *when* each pattern fits; the overview (Creational vs Structural vs Behavioral) is the map—the dedicated articles are the implementation.

---

## Trade-Offs & Failure Modes

- **What this sacrifices:** Extra types and indirection; each pattern adds structure. In return you get clarity and consistency when the problem recurs.
- **Where it degrades:** When patterns are applied for their own sake ("we need a Factory here") and the problem doesn't justify them; or when the team doesn't recognise the pattern and adds ad hoc logic.
- **How it fails when misapplied:** Strategy for two branches that never change; or Singleton for something that should be testable. Another failure: mixing similar patterns (e.g. Strategy vs State) without clarity.
- **Early warning signs:** "We have a pattern but we never vary it"; "nobody knows why we use this abstraction."

---

## What Most Guides Miss

Most guides list patterns. The hard part is **when to skip**: not every creation needs a Factory, not every state machine needs the full State pattern. The other gap: **Creational vs Structural vs Behavioral** as a decision tree—start with "is this about creation, composition, or interaction?" and then narrow. Finally: **fit with Clean Architecture**—patterns live in layers (composition, adapters, use cases); don't force a pattern that breaks the dependency rule.

---

## Decision Framework

- **If the problem is "how do we create this?"** → Creational: Factory, Builder, Singleton, Abstract Factory; choose by complexity and who decides the type.
- **If the problem is "how do we compose or wrap?"** → Structural: Adapter, Decorator, Facade; choose by whether you're changing interface or adding behaviour.
- **If the problem is "how do objects interact or who does what?"** → Behavioral: Strategy, Observer, Command, State, Mediator; choose by whether you're swapping logic, notifying, queuing, or managing state.
- **If you're not sure** → Read the overview and the dedicated article (Creational/Structural/Behavioral in .NET); match the problem to the pattern's intent.
- **If the pattern doesn't fit** → Prefer a simple solution; add the pattern when the problem recurs or when clarity suffers.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Creational = creation; Structural = composition/wrapping; Behavioral = interaction/responsibility; use the category to narrow the choice.
- Apply patterns when they solve a recurring problem and improve clarity; avoid applying them for their own sake.
- Match the problem to the pattern's intent; when in doubt, see the dedicated .NET articles for full code and when-to-use.
- Patterns fit in Clean Architecture: Creational in DI, Structural in adapters, Behavioral in use cases and domain.
- Simple conditionals or delegates often suffice; add structure when the problem recurs or when the design is hard to follow.

## Summary

Design patterns are **reusable templates** for common design problems, grouped into **Creational** (object creation), **Structural** (composition), and **Behavioral** (interaction and responsibility). Use them when they **solve a recurring problem** and make the design clearer. This overview gives the big picture and when to use which category; for **full code**, **class diagrams**, and **use cases** for each pattern, see [Creational in .NET](/blog/creational-design-patterns-dotnet), [Structural in .NET](/blog/structural-design-patterns-dotnet), and [Behavioral in .NET](/blog/behavioral-design-patterns-dotnet).

## When I Would Use This Again — and When I Wouldn't

I would use this overview again when I'm introducing design patterns or deciding which category (Creational, Structural, Behavioral) fits a problem—then drill into the dedicated articles for full code. I wouldn't use it as a substitute for the detailed .NET articles when I need implementation. I also wouldn't force a pattern when a simple solution works; the overview is a map, not a mandate. Alternative: for experienced teams that already know the catalog, use it as a quick "which category?" reference and jump to the pattern that fits.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are design patterns?

Design patterns are **reusable solutions** to common problems in software design. They are templates (not copy-paste code) for structuring code. The GoF defined 23 patterns in three categories: Creational, Structural, Behavioral.

### What is Creational?

Creational patterns are about **how objects are created**: deferring creation, reusing instances, abstracting construction. Examples: Factory Method, Builder, Prototype, Singleton. See [Creational patterns in .NET](/blog/creational-design-patterns-dotnet) for code and comparison.

### What is Structural?

Structural patterns are about **how objects are composed** into larger structures: wrapping interfaces, simplifying subsystems, sharing state. Examples: Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy. See [Structural patterns in .NET](/blog/structural-design-patterns-dotnet) for code and comparison.

### What is Behavioral?

Behavioral patterns are about **how objects interact** and distribute responsibility: notifying observers, switching algorithms, encapsulating requests. Examples: Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Template Method. See [Behavioral patterns in .NET](/blog/behavioral-design-patterns-dotnet) for code and comparison.

### What is the difference between Creational, Structural, and Behavioral?

**Creational** = how objects are **created**. **Structural** = how objects are **composed** into larger structures. **Behavioral** = how objects **interact** and share responsibility.

### When should I use a design pattern?

Use a pattern when it **solves a recurring problem** in your codebase and makes the design clearer. Do not force a pattern where a simple solution suffices.

### Should I use Singleton?

Use Singleton only when you truly need **one instance** globally (e.g. logger, config). Prefer **dependency injection** and registering a single instance in the container so tests can replace it.

### What is Factory Method vs Abstract Factory?

**Factory Method:** one method creates one product; subclasses decide the concrete type. **Abstract Factory:** a family of factories for related products. Use Factory Method for one product; Abstract Factory for families.

### What is Decorator vs Adapter?

**Decorator** adds behaviour to an object without changing its interface. **Adapter** changes the interface of an existing object to match what the client expects. Both wrap; Decorator adds behaviour, Adapter changes interface.

### What is Strategy vs State?

**Strategy:** switch algorithms at runtime; the context delegates to the strategy. **State:** object behaviour depends on internal state; state object encapsulates state-specific behaviour. Strategy is about algorithm; State is about state transitions.

### What is Observer vs Pub/Sub?

**Observer:** one-to-many; subject notifies observers directly (in-process). **Pub/Sub:** decoupled; publisher and subscriber do not know each other; message broker in between (often across services).

### When should I use Builder?

Use Builder when object construction is **complex** (many optional parameters, steps). Builder separates construction from representation and makes the API readable (e.g. fluent API).

### What is Facade used for?

Facade provides a **simple interface** to a complex subsystem. Use it when you want to hide complexity and give clients one entry point. Common in APIs and service layers.

### What is Command pattern used for?

Command **encapsulates a request** as an object. Use for undo/redo, queues, macros, or when you need to parameterise operations (e.g. delay execution, log, replay).

### How do design patterns fit with Clean Architecture?

Patterns live in layers: **Creational** in composition/DI; **Structural** in adapters and infrastructure; **Behavioral** in use cases and domain. Clean Architecture defines boundaries; patterns implement them.

### Where can I find full .NET code for each pattern?

See the dedicated articles: [Creational in .NET](/blog/creational-design-patterns-dotnet), [Structural in .NET](/blog/structural-design-patterns-dotnet), [Behavioral in .NET](/blog/behavioral-design-patterns-dotnet). Each has class diagrams, use cases, and full C# examples with file-level detail.
