  content: `## Introduction

This guidance is relevant when the topic of this article applies to your system or design choices; it breaks down when constraints or context differ. I've applied it in real projects and refined the takeaways over time (as of 2026).

**Property management systems** in the UK must handle **tenancy law**, **deposit protection**, **right-to-rent checks**, **reporting**, and **multi-tenant operations**—requirements that affect both **architecture** and **UX**. From enterprise property platforms managing **large portfolios** (e.g. thousands of homes, billions in value), property software is as much about **compliance** and **trust** as it is about features. This article gives an **in-depth**, **newbie-friendly** guide: what UK property management software does, **UK compliance** (tenancy deposit schemes, right-to-rent, GDPR, reporting), **tenancy lifecycle**, **data model**, **tech stack** (aligned with modern platforms: Angular, .NET, Azure), **integrations**, and **best practices**.

If you are new, start with [Topics covered](#topics-covered) and [UK property management at a glance](#uk-property-management-at-a-glance). We explain **TDP**, **prescribed information**, **right-to-rent**, **tenancy lifecycle**, **data model**, **Azure** (Functions, Logic Apps, Service Bus), and **FAQs** with concrete detail.

## Decision Context

- **System scale:** Varies by context; the approach in this article applies to the scales and scenarios described in the body.
- **Team size:** Typically small to medium teams; ownership and clarity matter more than headcount.
- **Time / budget pressure:** Applicable under delivery pressure; I've used it in both greenfield and incremental refactors.
- **Technical constraints:** .NET and related stack where relevant; constraints are noted in the article where they affect the approach.
- **Non-goals:** This article does not optimize for every possible scenario; boundaries are stated where they matter.


## What is property management software in the UK and why compliance matters

**Property management software** is software used by **landlords**, **letting agents**, or **property managers** to manage **properties**, **tenancies**, **tenants**, **rent collection**, **maintenance**, **deposits**, and **compliance**. In the **UK**, **compliance** is strict and **legally required**:

- **Tenancy deposit protection (TDP):** Residential deposits must be protected in a **government-approved scheme** (DPS, MyDeposits, TDS) within **30 days** of receipt, and **prescribed information** must be given to the tenant. Failure can result in **penalties** (e.g. 1–3× deposit) and inability to serve a valid section 21 notice.
- **Right-to-rent:** Landlords (or agents) must **verify** tenants' immigration status before the tenancy starts. Checks differ for **UK** and **non-UK** nationals; your system must **record** check date, outcome, and document references (within **GDPR** limits).
- **GDPR and data retention:** Tenant and landlord data is **personal data**. You must define **retention periods**, support **subject access** and **deletion**, and **audit** who accessed what.
- **Reporting:** Tax, audits, and regulators often require **export** (CSV, PDF), **date-range filters**, and **audit logs** so that stakeholders can prove compliance.

Your system must **record** and **audit** these so that stakeholders can **prove** compliance. Property software is as much about **compliance** and **trust** as it is about features—invest in both from day one.

## UK property management at a glance

| Concept | What it is (simple) |
|--------|----------------------|
| **TDP (tenancy deposit scheme)** | Government-approved scheme (DPS, MyDeposits, TDS) where **deposits** must be **protected** within **30 days**. Tenant must receive **prescribed information**. |
| **Prescribed information** | Information that **must** be given to the tenant when a deposit is protected (e.g. scheme details, how to get the deposit back, dispute process). Your system must **record** when and how it was sent. |
| **Right-to-rent** | Landlords/agents must **verify** tenants' **immigration status** before the tenancy starts. Rules differ for UK and non-UK nationals. Record **check date**, **outcome**, **document type**. |
| **Tenancy lifecycle** | Application → referencing → tenancy agreement → move-in → rent/maintenance → move-out → deposit return. System must support each stage and **compliance** at the right points. |
| **Multi-tenancy (software)** | Multiple **agencies** or **landlords** in one system; data **isolated** by org (tenant ID or org ID in every table). **RBAC** so users only see their org's data. |

## Tenancy deposit protection (TDP) in depth: schemes, 30-day rule, prescribed information

**What TDP is:** In England and Wales (and similar in Scotland/NI), **residential** tenancy deposits must be **protected** in a **government-approved scheme** within **30 days** of receipt. The tenant must receive **prescribed information** (scheme name, how to get deposit back, dispute process, etc.). If not, the landlord can face **penalties** (1–3× the deposit) and **cannot** serve a valid **section 21** (no-fault eviction) notice.

**Schemes:** The main **custodial** and **insured** schemes in England/Wales include **DPS** (Deposit Protection Service), **MyDeposits**, **TDS** (Tenancy Deposit Scheme). Scotland has **SafeDeposits**, **Letting Protection Scotland**, **MyDeposits Scotland**. Each has its own **API** or **process** (sometimes file-based) for protecting deposits and submitting prescribed information. Your system may need to support **one or more** depending on your clients.

**30-day rule:** The **clock** starts when you **receive** the deposit. Your system must **record** the date of receipt and the date of protection. **Workflow:** Collect deposit → protect with chosen scheme (API or file) → get protection reference → send prescribed information to tenant (and record when/how). If you miss 30 days, you are in breach; the system should **flag** approaching deadlines (e.g. "Protect within 7 days").

**Prescribed information:** **Exact** content is set by legislation; it typically includes: scheme name and contact details, landlord/agent details, property address, amount protected, how the tenant can get the deposit back, what happens in a dispute. Your system should **store** the prescribed information **sent** (or a reference to it) and **record** the date and method (e.g. email, post) so you can prove it was given.

**Dispute and repayment:** When the tenancy ends, the deposit is **repaid** (or disputed). Schemes have their own **dispute resolution** and **repayment** flows. Your system should **track** status (protected, repayment requested, disputed, repaid) and **integrate** with the scheme where the scheme allows (API or portal).

---

## Right-to-rent in depth: checks, documents, UK vs non-UK nationals

**What right-to-rent is:** Landlords (or their agents) in England must **check** that tenants have the **right to rent** (immigration status) **before** the tenancy starts. Checks are **ongoing** for some tenancies (e.g. time-limited leave). Failure to check (or to do it correctly) can result in **civil penalties** and (in serious cases) **criminal** liability.

**UK nationals:** Usually proved with **passport** (or birth certificate + other ID). **Non-UK nationals:** Usually **Biometric Residence Permit** or **passport with visa**. The **Home Office** publishes guidance and a **digital checking service** (for eligible tenants). Your system should **record**: check **date**, **outcome** (pass/fail/refer), **document type** (within GDPR—do not store full document numbers if not required; store only what is needed for audit).

**Manual vs digital:** Checks can be **manual** (agent views physical documents and records outcome) or **digital** (tenant uses Home Office online service; you get a result). Your system should support **both**: a "manual check" flow (record date, outcome, document type) and, if you integrate with the digital service, **store** the reference and outcome.

**Timing:** The check must be done **before** the tenancy **starts** (or before the tenant moves in, depending on interpretation). For **renewals** or **ongoing** tenancies, follow current guidance (e.g. follow-up checks for time-limited leave). Your **tenancy** and **right-to-rent** data model should link so you can report "tenancies with valid right-to-rent" and "checks due".

**GDPR:** Document data is **sensitive**. Store only what is **necessary** for compliance and audit (e.g. check date, outcome, document type—not necessarily full document copy). Define **retention** (e.g. duration of tenancy + X years) and **secure** access (RBAC, audit log).

---

## Tenancy lifecycle: application to move-out and deposit return

**End-to-end lifecycle:**

1. **Application:** Tenant applies (form, references). System stores **application**, **property**, **proposed start date**.
2. **Referencing:** Credit/reference checks (internal or third-party). Record **outcome** (pass/fail/refer).
3. **Right-to-rent:** Perform check **before** tenancy; record outcome (see above).
4. **Tenancy agreement:** Generate/sign agreement. Record **start date**, **end date**, **rent**, **deposit amount**.
5. **Deposit receipt:** Record **date received**, **amount**. **Protect** with TDP within **30 days**; send **prescribed information**; record both.
6. **Move-in:** Record **move-in date**, **inventory** (if used). Link **deposit** to **tenancy** and **scheme**.
7. **Rent collection:** Rent due dates, payments, arrears. Integrate with **payments** or **bank feeds** as needed.
8. **Maintenance:** Requests, assignments, completion. Track **status** and **cost**.
9. **Move-out:** **Check-out** date, **inventory** (condition). **Deposit return**: request repayment or dispute; track **status** with scheme.
10. **Post-tenancy:** **Audit** and **retention** of tenancy and deposit records for **compliance** and **disputes**.

Your **data model** and **UX** should support each stage: **wizards** for deposit protection and right-to-rent, **validation** (e.g. "Protect deposit before move-in"), **audit** (who did what and when).

---

## Data model: properties, tenancies, deposits, rent, maintenance, audit

**Core entities:**

- **Property:** Address, type, landlord/agent, org (for multi-tenancy). Links to **tenancies**.
- **Tenancy:** Property, tenant(s), start/end date, rent amount, status (prospective, active, ended). Links to **deposit**, **right-to-rent**, **rent schedule**, **maintenance**.
- **Tenant:** Contact details, references. Links to **tenancies** (and **right-to-rent** per tenancy).
- **Deposit:** Tenancy, amount, **date received**, **date protected**, **scheme**, **protection reference**, **prescribed information sent** (date, method). Status: received, protected, repayment_requested, disputed, repaid.
- **RightToRentCheck:** Tenancy, **check date**, **outcome**, **document type** (or reference), **checker**. Optional: link to digital check reference.
- **Rent / Payment:** Tenancy, due date, amount, paid date, status.
- **MaintenanceRequest:** Property/tenancy, description, status, assigned to, completed date.
- **AuditLog:** Entity type, entity ID, **who**, **what**, **when** (CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, UpdatedBy). Use for **tenancy**, **deposit**, **sensitive** updates so disputes and compliance reviews are traceable.

**Multi-tenancy:** Every table that is **org-scoped** has **OrgId** (or **AgencyId**). **RBAC:** Users are assigned to an org; queries **filter** by OrgId so that agencies/landlords only see their own data.

**Versioning:** For **tenancy** and **deposit** records, consider **versioning** (e.g. version number or history table) so that changes (e.g. deposit amount corrected) are traceable.

---

## Tech stack: Angular, .NET, Azure (Functions, Logic Apps, Service Bus)

**Typical stack** for enterprise UK property platforms (aligned with large-scale implementations):

- **Frontend:** **Angular** (TypeScript) for responsive **property management** and **tenant portal**: portfolio view, tenancy lifecycle, deposit and right-to-rent wizards, reporting. **Real-time** updates and **secure** auth (e.g. Azure AD or OAuth).
- **Backend:** **.NET Core Web API** (or .NET 6+) for **property**, **tenancy**, **deposit**, **rent**, **maintenance** APIs. **Microservices** or **modular monolith** depending on scale; **REST** or **gRPC** for internal services.
- **Database:** **Azure SQL Database** for **relational** data (properties, tenancies, deposits, audit). **Indexing** and **query** design for large portfolios (e.g. 9,000+ properties); **connection pooling** and **resilience** (retries, timeouts).
- **Serverless and workflows:** **Azure Functions** for **event-driven** tasks (e.g. "deposit protected" → send prescribed information, "rent due" → reminder). **Azure Logic Apps** for **workflow** automation (e.g. TDP integration, approval steps). **Azure Service Bus** for **messaging** (events between services, async processing, **dead-letter** for failed TDP calls).
- **Storage:** **Azure Blob Storage** for **documents** (tenancy agreements, prescribed information PDFs, check evidence). **Azure Key Vault** for **secrets** (TDP API keys, DB connection strings).
- **Monitoring:** **Application Insights** (or similar) for **logs**, **traces**, **alerts**. **Audit** logs for compliance (who accessed what).

This stack supports **scalability** (e.g. 9,000+ properties), **compliance** (audit, versioning, integrations), and **operational efficiency** (automation, tenant self-service).

---

## Integrations: TDP schemes, idempotency, reconciliation

**TDP integrations:** Each scheme (DPS, MyDeposits, TDS, etc.) has its own **API** or **process** (sometimes **file upload**). Your system **calls** the scheme to **protect** a deposit and (where supported) to **submit** prescribed information or get **repayment** status. Design for **retries** (transient failures) and **idempotency**: **duplicate** submissions (e.g. same tenancy/deposit) must **not** create **duplicate** protections. Use **idempotency keys** (e.g. TenancyId + DepositId) or **unique reference** per protection; store **processed** keys so retries are safe. **Reconciliation:** Periodically **reconcile** your records with the scheme (e.g. list of protections) so that your DB matches the scheme; flag **mismatches** for manual review.

**Right-to-rent:** If you use the **Home Office digital service**, integrate via their **API**; store **reference** and **outcome** only (no unnecessary document data). **Manual** checks: UX to **record** outcome and date; no external API.

**Payments:** If you integrate with **payment providers** (e.g. rent collection), use **webhooks** or **polling** with **idempotency** so that duplicate events do not double-credit or double-charge.

**Deposit protection:** **Wizard** (e.g. Step 1: Enter deposit amount and date received; Step 2: Choose scheme and protect; Step 3: Send prescribed information and record). **Validation:** "Date received" required; "Protect within 30 days" warning/block if overdue. **Prescribed information:** Show **what** will be sent (or template); **record** "Sent on [date] by [method]". **Errors:** Plain-language messages (e.g. "Protection failed: invalid reference. Check scheme and retry.").

**Right-to-rent:** **Wizard** (e.g. Step 1: Check type (manual/digital); Step 2: Record outcome and date; Step 3: Confirm and save). **Validation:** Check must be **before** tenancy start; do not allow move-in without valid check if your policy requires it. **Audit display:** "Right-to-rent checked on [date]; outcome: Pass. Document type: UK passport."

**Audit trail:** **Audit** table (who, what, when) and **versioning** for key entities. In UX, show **"History"** or **"Audit"** for tenancy and deposit so agents and managers can see **who changed what and when**—essential for **disputes** and **compliance reviews**.

---

## GDPR and data retention: retention periods, subject access, deletion

**GDPR:** Tenant and landlord data is **personal data**. You must: **lawful basis** (e.g. contract, legal obligation), **retention** (how long you keep data), **subject access** (export of personal data), **deletion** (right to be forgotten where applicable), **security** (access control, encryption), **audit** (who accessed what).

**Retention:** Define **retention periods** (e.g. tenancy data: duration of tenancy + 7 years for tax/legal; deposit records: same). **Archive** or **delete** after retention; **document** in privacy policy. Your system should support **scheduled** jobs or **manual** "archive/delete after retention" so that data is not kept indefinitely.

**Subject access:** **Export** of a tenant's (or landlord's) personal data in a **machine-readable** format (e.g. JSON or CSV). Build an **API** and **admin UX** so that requests can be fulfilled within the **statutory** timeframe.

**Deletion:** **Right to erasure** (where it applies—e.g. no longer necessary, consent withdrawn). **Anonymise** or **delete**; be aware that **legal** or **compliance** obligations may require **keeping** some data (e.g. deposit protection records for disputes). **Audit** deletion (who deleted what and when).

---

## Reporting and export: tax, audits, CSV/PDF, audit logs

**Reporting:** **Rent rolls**, **arrears**, **deposit status**, **right-to-rent status**, **maintenance** metrics. Build **reporting** into the **API** (filter by date range, org, property) and **UX** (dashboards, export). **Tax** and **audits** often need **export** (CSV, PDF) with **date-range** filters and **audit logs** (who did what) so that stakeholders can **prove** compliance.

**Export:** **CSV** for bulk data (e.g. tenancies, deposits, payments); **PDF** for **reports** (e.g. deposit certificate, tenancy summary). **Audit logs:** Export of **audit** table (who, what, when) for a given entity or date range—essential for **disputes** and **compliance reviews**. Build these into the **API** and **UX** from the start.

---

## Security and multi-tenancy: agencies, landlords, RBAC

**Multi-tenancy:** Multiple **agencies** or **landlords** in one system. **Data isolation:** **OrgId** (or AgencyId) on every org-scoped table; **all** queries **filter** by OrgId. **RBAC:** Roles (e.g. admin, agent, landlord) and **permissions** (e.g. view tenancies, protect deposit, run reports). Users are **assigned** to an org; they **only** see their org's data.

**Security:** **HTTPS** everywhere; **secure** storage (encryption at rest); **access control** (auth + RBAC). **Secrets** (API keys, DB connection strings) in **Azure Key Vault** (or equivalent); **never** in code or config in source control. **Audit** access to **sensitive** data (e.g. who viewed tenant PII).

---

## Best practices and pitfalls

**Do:** Treat **compliance** (TDP, right-to-rent, GDPR) as **first-class** in the data model and UX. **Record** dates (receipt, protection, prescribed information sent, right-to-rent check). **Audit** who changed what and when. **Idempotency** on TDP and payment integrations. **Reconcile** with TDP schemes. **Clear** UX (wizards, validation, plain-language errors). **Retention** and **deletion** policies documented and implemented.

**Do not:** **Retrofit** compliance after launch—build it in from day one. **Skip** prescribed information or protection tracking—you cannot prove compliance without it. **Store** more document data than **necessary** (GDPR). **Ignore** 30-day deadline—flag and enforce in workflow. **Forget** multi-tenant isolation—one org must never see another's data.

---
---

## Position & Rationale

I treat **UK compliance** (TDP, right-to-rent, GDPR, reporting) as **first-class** in the data model and UX—not retrofitted. I insist on **protecting the deposit within 30 days** and **recording** protection date, prescribed information sent, and scheme; I use **idempotency** and **reconciliation** with TDP schemes so we never double-submit or lose sync. I enforce **right-to-rent** check before tenancy and record date and outcome; I support manual and digital checks. I model the **tenancy lifecycle** (application to move-out and deposit return) with **wizards** and **audit** so every stage is traceable. I reject launching without TDP and right-to-rent in the data model and workflow—you cannot prove compliance after the fact.

## Trade-Offs & Failure Modes

- **What this sacrifices:** Some simplicity, extra structure, or operational cost depending on the topic; the article body covers specifics.
- **Where it degrades:** Under scale or when misapplied; early warning signs include drift from the intended use and repeated workarounds.
- **How it fails when misapplied:** Using it where constraints don't match, or over-applying it. The "When I Would Use This Again" section below reinforces boundaries.
- **Early warning signs:** Team confusion, bypasses, or "we're doing X but not really" indicate a mismatch.

---

## What Most Guides Miss

Most material on property systems is either generic "build a dashboard" or UK-specific compliance in isolation. What they skip: **tenancy and deposits are legally sticky**—wrong handling can mean fines or disputes; **integration with referencing, contracts, and accounting**—if those are separate systems, you're building glue and reconciliation, not just CRUD; and **who owns data quality**—wrong addresses, duplicate tenants, or stale inventory break reporting and compliance. The hard part is the boundaries between lettings, maintenance, and finance, and the failure modes when one system is wrong. This article reflects lessons from real systems, not doc-only knowledge.

---

## Decision Framework

- **If the context matches the assumptions in this article** → Apply the approach as described; adapt to your scale and team.
- **If constraints differ** → Revisit Decision Context and Trade-Offs; simplify or choose an alternative.
- **If you're under heavy time pressure** → Use the minimal subset that gives the most value; expand later.
- **If ownership is unclear** → Clarify before scaling the approach; unclear ownership is an early warning sign.

---

## Key Takeaways

- The article body and Summary capture the technical content; this section distils judgment.
- Apply the approach where context and constraints match; avoid over-application.
- Trade-offs and failure modes are real; treat them as part of the decision.
- Revisit "When I Would Use This Again" when deciding on a new project or refactor.


## Summary

UK property management systems must **embed compliance** (TDP, right-to-rent, GDPR, reporting) in the **data model** and **UX**. **Tenancy deposit protection:** protect within 30 days, send prescribed information, record both; integrate with schemes with **idempotency** and **reconciliation**. **Right-to-rent:** check before tenancy, record date and outcome; support manual and digital. **Tenancy lifecycle:** application to move-out and deposit return—support each stage with **wizards** and **audit**. **Tech stack:** Angular, .NET API, Azure SQL, Azure Functions, Logic Apps, Service Bus, Key Vault—scalable and compliant. **Security** and **multi-tenancy:** RBAC, OrgId isolation, Key Vault, audit logs. Property software is as much about **compliance** and **trust** as it is about features—invest in both from day one.

## When I Would Use This Again — and When I Wouldn't

I would use this approach again for any **UK property management** product where TDP, right-to-rent, and GDPR apply—embed compliance in the data model and UX, idempotency and reconciliation with schemes, multi-tenant isolation and audit. I wouldn't launch without TDP and right-to-rent in place; you can't prove compliance after the fact. I wouldn't use the full stack (Angular, .NET, Azure, Logic Apps, Service Bus) for a tiny lettings spreadsheet; I'd still apply the compliance and isolation patterns even on a smaller stack. If the product is for another jurisdiction, I'd swap UK rules for local equivalents (deposit schemes, identity checks) but keep the principle: compliance and trust are first-class, not retrofitted.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is property management software?

Software used by **landlords**, **letting agents**, or **property managers** to manage **properties**, **tenancies**, **tenants**, **rent**, **maintenance**, **deposits**, and **compliance**. In the UK, **compliance** (TDP, right-to-rent, GDPR) is strict and must be built in from day one.

### What is a tenancy deposit scheme (TDP) in the UK?

**TDP** requires **residential** deposits to be **protected** in a **government-approved scheme** (e.g. DPS, MyDeposits, TDS) within **30 days** of receipt. The tenant must receive **prescribed information**. Your system must **record** protection **date**, **scheme**, **reference**, and **when** prescribed information was sent. Failure can result in **penalties** and inability to serve a valid section 21 notice.

### What is prescribed information for deposits?

**Prescribed information** is the information that **must** be given to the tenant when a deposit is protected (e.g. scheme details, how to get the deposit back, dispute process). Your system should **record** when and how it was sent (e.g. email, post) so you can **prove** compliance.

### What is right-to-rent and how do I support it in software?

**Right-to-rent** requires landlords/agents to **verify** tenants' **immigration status** before the tenancy starts. Your system should **record** check **date**, **outcome** (pass/fail/refer), **document type** (within GDPR). Support **manual** (agent records outcome) and **digital** (Home Office service) where applicable. Rules differ for **UK** and **non-UK** nationals.

### How do I handle GDPR and data retention in property software?

Define **retention periods** for tenant and landlord data; support **subject access** (export) and **deletion** (right to erasure where applicable). **Audit** who accessed what. Store only what is **necessary**; document retention and deletion in your **privacy policy**. Use **RBAC** and **secure** storage (Key Vault for secrets).

### What tech stack fits UK property management?

**Typical** enterprise stack: **Angular** frontend, **.NET Core** Web API, **Azure SQL**, **Azure Functions**, **Logic Apps**, **Service Bus**, **Key Vault**, **Blob Storage**, **Application Insights**. Supports **scalability** (e.g. 9,000+ properties), **compliance** (audit, integrations), and **automation** (serverless, event-driven).

### How do I integrate with TDP schemes?

Each scheme (DPS, MyDeposits, TDS) has its own **API** or **process** (sometimes file-based). Design for **retries** and **idempotency** (e.g. TenancyId + DepositId as idempotency key) so **duplicate** submissions do **not** create duplicate protections. **Reconcile** with the scheme periodically so your records match.

### What should I include in an audit trail for property software?

**Who** changed **what** and **when** (CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, UpdatedBy); **versioning** for tenancy and deposit records so that history is traceable for **disputes** and **compliance reviews**. Include **deposit** (protection date, prescribed information sent) and **right-to-rent** (check date, outcome).

### How do I design UX for deposit protection and right-to-rent?

**Wizards** for deposit protection (enter amount → protect → send prescribed information) and right-to-rent (record outcome and date). **Validation** (e.g. protect within 30 days; check before tenancy start). **Plain-language** error messages. **Audit** display (e.g. "Prescribed information sent on [date]").

### What reporting do UK property systems need?

**Export** (CSV, PDF) for **tax** and **audits**; **date-range** filters; **audit logs** (who did what). Build **reporting** and **export** into the API and UX from the start so that stakeholders can **prove** compliance.

### How do I avoid duplicate deposit protections when integrating with TDP?

Use **idempotency keys** (e.g. TenancyId + DepositId) or **unique reference** per protection; store **processed** keys so **retries** do not create duplicate protections. **Reconcile** with the scheme periodically to ensure your records match.

### What is the difference between DPS, MyDeposits, and TDS?

They are **government-approved** tenancy deposit schemes in England/Wales (Scotland has others). Each has its own **API** or **process** for protecting deposits and submitting prescribed information. Your system may need to support **one or more** depending on your clients.

### How do I handle right-to-rent when tenants are from different countries?

**UK nationals:** Usually passport (or birth certificate + ID). **Non-UK nationals:** Usually **Biometric Residence Permit** or passport with visa. Your system should **record** check date, **outcome**, **document type**; support **manual** and **digital** checks as required. Follow **Home Office** guidance.

### What security considerations are there for property data?

Tenant and landlord data is **sensitive**. Use **HTTPS**, **secure** storage, **access control** (RBAC), **audit logs**. Comply with **GDPR** (retention, access, deletion). Store **credentials** and **API keys** in **Key Vault**; never in code or config in source control.

### How do I support multiple agencies or landlords in one system?

**Multi-tenancy:** **OrgId** (or AgencyId) on every org-scoped table; **all** queries **filter** by OrgId. **RBAC:** Users assigned to an org; they **only** see their org's data. Consider **separate DB per tenant** vs **shared DB with OrgId** based on scale and compliance.
