  content: `## Introduction

**What developers actually want** from **AI assistants** is often **not** “more code”—it’s **context** (the AI understands my codebase), **control** (I can edit, reject, steer), **consistency** (output matches our style and patterns), and **clarity** (explanations I can trust). This article spells out **what developers want** and how that **differs** from what tools **default** to, so teams and vendors can align.

We cover **context awareness**, **control and editability**, **consistency**, **clarity and explanation**, and **what to prioritise** when choosing or using tools. For tool comparison see [Cursor vs Claude Code vs Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide); for what IDEs get right and wrong see [What AI IDEs Get Right — and What They Get Wrong](/blog/ai-ides-what-they-get-right-wrong); for daily use see [How Developers Are Integrating AI Into Daily Workflows](/blog/developers-integrating-ai-daily-workflows).

## Decision Context

- **When this applies:** Teams or product owners evaluating or improving AI coding tools and team norms, and who want a synthesis of what developers report they need.
- **When it doesn't:** Readers who want a single study or tool comparison. This article is a synthesis of reported priorities (context, control, consistency, clarity).
- **Scale:** Any team size; the priorities apply across contexts.
- **Constraints:** Aligning tools and norms with these priorities requires product and process change, not just prompts.
- **Non-goals:** This article isn't a survey; it summarises recurring themes so teams can decide what to improve first.

## Why “what developers want” matters

**Tools** that match **what developers want** get **adopted** and **sustained**; tools that **only** maximise **output** can **increase** **review** load, **debt**, and **frustration**—see [Impact of AI Tools on Code Quality and Maintainability](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability) and [Why AI Productivity Gains Plateau](/blog/why-ai-productivity-gains-plateau). [Technical leadership](/blog/technical-leadership-remote-teams) and **product** decisions should align with these needs.

## What developers want at a glance

| Want | What it means | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Context** | AI sees **file**, **codebase**, **conventions** | Relevant suggestions, fewer wrong guesses |
| **Control** | **Edit**, **reject**, **steer**; not black box | Ownership, correctness |
| **Consistency** | Output matches **style**, **patterns**, **architecture** | [Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability), [maintainability](/blog/clean-architecture-dotnet) |
| **Clarity** | **Explanations** I can **verify**; no “trust me” | Learning, review, [where AI fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development) |

## Context awareness

Developers want the AI to **understand** the **current file**, **project** structure, **existing** patterns (e.g. [Clean Architecture](/blog/clean-architecture-dotnet), [design patterns](/blog/design-patterns-overview-creational-structural-behavioral)), and **conventions**. **Suggestions** that **ignore** context (wrong API, wrong layer, wrong style) are **rejected** or **heavily** edited—see [What AI IDEs Get Right — and What They Get Wrong](/blog/ai-ides-what-they-get-right-wrong). Tools like [Cursor](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide) with **@codebase** move in this direction; **more** context usually means **more** useful output.

---

## Control and editability

Developers want **control**: **accept** or **reject** suggestions, **edit** before commit, **steer** (e.g. “use our repository pattern”, “no mutable globals”). **Black-box** output that’s **hard** to change or **override** is **frustrating**. [Trade-Offs of Relying on AI for Code Generation](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation) and [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability) both emphasise **review** and **ownership**—control is how that happens.

---

## Consistency

Developers want **consistency**: **naming**, **structure**, **patterns** that match the **rest** of the codebase. **Inconsistent** output (different style, wrong [SOLID](/blog/solid-principles-in-practice) or layer) creates **debt** and **review** churn—see [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development). **Linters**, **formatters**, and **explicit** instructions (“follow our API style”) help; so do tools that **learn** from the repo.

---

## Clarity and explanation

Developers want **clarity**: **why** did the AI suggest this? **What** does this code do? **Explanations** that are **verifiable** (and **honest** when uncertain) build **trust** and **learning**. [How AI Is Changing Code Review and Testing](/blog/ai-changing-code-review-testing) and [What AI IDEs Get Right and Wrong](/blog/ai-ides-what-they-get-right-wrong) note that **explanations** are a **strength** of **chat** and **Claude-style** flows—use them.

---

## What to prioritise

When **choosing** or **rolling out** AI tools, **prioritise**: (1) **context** (codebase-aware > file-only where possible); (2) **control** (easy to edit, reject, steer); (3) **consistency** (linters, style guides, examples); (4) **clarity** (explanations, uncertainty stated). See [Current State of AI Coding Tools](/blog/current-state-ai-coding-tools-2026) and [Cursor vs Claude Code vs Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide). [Technical leadership](/blog/technical-leadership-remote-teams) can set **norms** (when to use AI, when to review) so that **what developers want** aligns with **quality** and **delivery**.

---

## Real-world: what developers ask for

Developers often ask for: "Suggestions that match our repo style"; "I want to edit or reject easily"; "Explain why you suggested this"; "Don't change things outside this file." These map to **context**, **control**, **clarity**, and **consistency**. Tools that **only** maximise **output** (long completions, few edit points) get **pushback**; tools that **expose** **context** (e.g. @codebase), **edit/reject** flow, and **explanations** get **adopted**. See [Cursor vs Claude Code vs Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide) and [What AI IDEs Get Right and Wrong](/blog/ai-ides-what-they-get-right-wrong).

---

## Code-level examples: missing context and consistency

When the AI **lacks context** or **consistency** guidance, you get **code that doesn't match** what developers want. Below: **exact prompt**, **full** **bad** output (no codebase context), **what goes wrong**, and **full** **good** output (with context or steering).

### Example 1: No context — wrong layer and style

**Exact prompt (file-only tool):** "Add an endpoint to create an order."

**What you get in theory (bad AI output):** Controller with **direct** **DB** access and **snake_case** or **wrong** naming—**ignores** your [Clean Architecture](/blog/clean-architecture-dotnet) and **PascalCase** API style.

\`\`\`csharp
// BAD: No codebase context — wrong layer, wrong naming
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> create_order(OrderRequest req)
{
    var o = new Order { customer_id = req.customer_id, total = req.total };
    _db.Orders.Add(o);
    await _db.SaveChangesAsync();
    return Ok(o.id);
}
\`\`\`

**What goes wrong at code level:** **Controller** touches **DbContext**; **naming** (\`create_order\`, \`customer_id\`) **does not match** existing API (\`Create\`, \`CustomerId\`). **Result in theory:** **Reject** or **heavy** **edit**—**frustration** and **debt**.

**Correct approach (with context or steering):** "Use our use-case pattern; PascalCase; no DbContext in controller." **Good** output:

\`\`\`csharp
// GOOD: Matches repo — controller delegates; PascalCase
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> Create(OrderRequest request)
{
    var result = await _createOrderUseCase.Execute(request);
    return result.Match<IActionResult>(id => Ok(id), err => BadRequest(err));
}
\`\`\`

---

### Example 2: Inconsistent — different pattern in second file

**Exact prompt (file A):** "Add method to get order by ID." **Prompt (file B):** "Add method to fetch order."

**What you get in theory (bad AI output):** **Two** different names and **async** vs sync—**inconsistent** with what developers want (one **convention**).

\`\`\`csharp
// File A
public async Task<Order?> GetOrderByIdAsync(int id) => await _repo.Find(id);

// File B (inconsistent)
public Order? FetchOrder(int id) => _orderRepo.GetById(id);
\`\`\`

**What goes wrong at code level:** **Review** asks "use GetOrderByIdAsync everywhere"; **callers** mix **FetchOrder** and **GetOrderByIdAsync**. **Result in theory:** **Churn** and **confusion**.

**Correct approach (consistency):** **Codebase-aware** tool or **explicit** instruction: "We use GetXxxAsync for async repo methods." **Good** output:

\`\`\`csharp
// Both files: same convention
public async Task<Order?> GetOrderByIdAsync(int id, CancellationToken ct = default) =>
    await _repo.GetByIdAsync(id, ct);
\`\`\`

---

**Takeaway:** **Context** (codebase, conventions) and **consistency** (one style, one pattern) are what developers want; **without** them you get **full** bad code like above. Use **codebase-aware** tools or **explicit** steering—see [Context in practice](#context-in-practice-what-codebase-aware-means) and [Consistency](#consistency).

---

## Context in practice: what "codebase-aware" means

**File-only context.** Many tools see **only** the **current** file (or a **snippet**). **Suggestions** can **ignore** existing **patterns** (e.g. [repository](/blog/repository-pattern-unit-of-work-dotnet), [dependency injection](/blog/dependency-injection-dotnet-core)), **wrong** **layer** (e.g. SQL in a controller), or **wrong** **API** for your **versions**. **Result:** **Reject** or **heavy** **edit**; **frustration**. **Codebase-aware context.** Tools that **index** or **read** **multiple** files (e.g. **@codebase**, **@folder**) can **suggest** code that **matches** **naming**, **structure**, and **patterns** **better**. **Limits:** **Large** repos may **exceed** context **windows**; **vague** prompts still **produce** **wrong** or **overly** **broad** changes. **Best use:** **Specific** prompts and **review** every change. See [What AI IDEs Get Right and Wrong](/blog/ai-ides-what-they-get-right-wrong) and [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development). **Conventions and style.** **Explicit** instructions ("use our repository pattern," "async suffix for async methods") **improve** **consistency**. **Style guides** and **examples** in the repo give the model **concrete** **targets**. **Linters** and **formatters** **enforce** **mechanical** style; **human** review **catches** **architectural** and **semantic** **consistency**. See [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

---

## Control in practice: edit, reject, and steer

**Accept and reject.** Developers want **one-key** or **obvious** **accept** and **reject** (e.g. Tab vs Esc) so **flow** is **not** **broken**. **Partial** accept (e.g. accept **one** line or **one** block, edit the rest) is **valuable** when **suggestions** are **long** but **only** **part** is **correct**. **Steering.** **Inline** instructions ("use our repository pattern," "no mutable globals") let developers **constrain** **output**. **Chat** and **prompts** are **another** **steering** channel. **Document** **team** **steering** **conventions** so **everyone** **aligns**; see [Technical Leadership in Remote Teams](/blog/technical-leadership-remote-teams). **Ownership and review.** **Control** is how **ownership** and **review** happen: the **developer** **decides** what to **accept**, **edit**, or **reject** before **commit**. See [Trade-Offs of AI Code Generation](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation) and [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

---

## Consistency and clarity in practice

**Why drift happens.** AI has **no** **global** view of your **repo**; each **suggestion** is **local**. **Naming**, **error** handling, **structure** can **differ** across files. **What helps:** **Linters**, **formatters**, **documented** **patterns** ([Clean Architecture](/blog/clean-architecture-dotnet), [SOLID](/blog/solid-principles-in-practice)); **codebase-aware** tools; **human** review for **architectural** **consistency**. See [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development). **Clarity.** Developers want **explanations** (**why** this suggestion, **what** the code does) that are **verifiable**. **Uncertainty** ("I'm not sure about X; you may want to check") is **more** **valuable** than **confident** but **wrong** output. Use explanations as **scaffold**; **humans** **verify**—see [How AI Is Changing Code Review and Testing](/blog/ai-changing-code-review-testing).

---

## Tool selection checklist and related reading

**Checklist:** **Context** (file and, if possible, codebase)? **Control** (accept/reject, edit, steer)? **Consistency** (style guides, linters)? **Clarity** (explanations, uncertainty)? **Norms** (when to use AI, when to review)? See [Current State of AI Coding Tools](/blog/current-state-ai-coding-tools-2026) and [Cursor vs Claude Code vs Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide). **Related reading:** [Cursor vs Claude Code vs Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide), [What AI IDEs Get Right and Wrong](/blog/ai-ides-what-they-get-right-wrong), [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability), [How Developers Are Integrating AI](/blog/developers-integrating-ai-daily-workflows), [Trade-Offs](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation), [Technical Leadership](/blog/technical-leadership-remote-teams).

---

## Common issues and challenges

- **Tools that maximise output over control:** Some tools **push** long outputs with **limited** edit or **reject** flow. Developers **frustrate** when they cannot **steer** or **fix** easily—see [Cursor vs Copilot vs Claude Code](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide) for comparison.
- **Lack of context:** **File-only** or **snippet** context leads to **wrong** or **irrelevant** suggestions. **Prioritise** codebase-aware tools or **paste** enough context—see [Where AI still fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development).
- **Inconsistent output:** When AI **drifts** from team **style**, **review** churn goes up. **Linters**, **examples**, and **explicit** instructions help—see [Impact on code quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

---

## Best practices and pitfalls

**Do:**

- Choose tools that support **context**, **control**, **consistency**, **clarity**; set **norms** and **examples**; **review** and **refactor**.
- **Gather** feedback from developers; align with [technical leadership](/blog/technical-leadership-remote-teams) and [Impact on code quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

**Do not:**

- Assume **more output** = **better**; **ignore** feedback from developers; **skip** review. See [Developers Integrating AI](/blog/developers-integrating-ai-daily-workflows) and [Trade-Offs](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation).

## Quick reference: prioritise by want

| Want | Prioritise when choosing/using tools |
|------|--------------------------------------|
| **Context** | Codebase-aware > file-only; give enough context in prompts |
| **Control** | Easy edit, reject, steer; not black box |
| **Consistency** | Linters, style guides, explicit instructions |
| **Clarity** | Explanations, uncertainty stated when relevant |

## Summary

- Developers want **context**, **control**, **consistency**, and **clarity**—not just **more** code.
- **Align** tools and **norms** with these; **review** and **ownership** keep **quality** high.
- For more see [What AI IDEs Get Right and Wrong](/blog/ai-ides-what-they-get-right-wrong), [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability), and [How Developers Are Integrating AI](/blog/developers-integrating-ai-daily-workflows).

## Position & Rationale

The article summarises what developers consistently ask for: context (AI understands the codebase), control (edit, reject, steer), consistency (matches style and patterns), and clarity (explanations they can verify). That's drawn from surveys and reported pain points, not from a single study. The stance is that tools and norms should align with these; without context and control, adoption stays shallow or creates debt.

## Trade-Offs & Failure Modes

Giving more context to tools (e.g. full repo, docs) improves relevance but raises privacy and cost concerns. Giving more control (edit, reject) can slow raw output but improves quality and trust. Failure modes: optimising only for "more suggestions" without context or control; ignoring consistency so generated code doesn't match team patterns; assuming "better prompts" fix everything without tool or norm changes.

## What Most Guides Miss

Many guides focus on which tool or model to use and skip what developers actually say they need: context, control, consistency, clarity. Those map to product and process (how you use the tool, what norms you set), not just to the model. Another gap: "better code" vs "more code" is a real distinction; teams that only measure output often get more code and more debt.

## Decision Framework

- **If suggestions feel irrelevant or wrong** → Improve context (repo access, docs, examples) or narrow scope; don't assume more tokens fix it.
- **If developers reject or heavily edit most suggestions** → Add control (easy reject, edit-in-place) and consistency (style, patterns) so accepted output is usable.
- **If quality or debt is rising** → Align with what developers want: context, control, consistency; tighten review and ownership.
- **For norms** → Document how the team uses AI (when to accept, when to reject, what must be human-only).

## Key Takeaways

- Developers want context, control, consistency, and clarity—not just more code.
- Align tools and norms with these; review and ownership keep quality high.
- "Better code" and "more code" are different; outcome metrics (quality, debt) matter more than output metrics.

## When I Would Use This Again — and When I Wouldn't

Use this framing when evaluating or improving AI coding tools and when setting team norms. Don't use it as a single source of truth for "what all developers want"; it's a synthesis of reported priorities that teams can use to decide what to improve first.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What do developers want most from AI assistants?

**Context** (AI understands my codebase), **control** (edit, reject, steer), **consistency** (matches our style and patterns), **clarity** (explanations I can verify). Not just “more code.”

### Why is context important for AI coding tools?

**Relevant** suggestions (right API, right layer, right style) require **context**. Without it, suggestions are **wrong** or **irrelevant** and get **rejected** or **heavily** edited. See [Cursor vs Claude Code vs Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide) and [What AI IDEs Get Right and Wrong](/blog/ai-ides-what-they-get-right-wrong).

### How do we get consistent output from AI?

**Linters**, **formatters**, **style guides**, **examples** in the repo, and **explicit** instructions (“follow our repository pattern”). See [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development) and [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

### Do developers want more code or better code?

**Better** (relevant, consistent, explainable)—and **control** to **edit** or **reject**. “More” without **quality** and **control** increases **debt** and **review** load. See [Trade-Offs](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation) and [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

### How does “what developers want” affect tool choice?

Prioritise tools that offer **context** (e.g. codebase-aware), **control** (edit, reject, steer), **consistency** (style, patterns), **clarity** (explanations). See [Current State of AI Coding Tools](/blog/current-state-ai-coding-tools-2026) and [Cursor vs Copilot vs Claude Code](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide).

### What if our team wants different things from AI?

[Technical leadership](/blog/technical-leadership-remote-teams) can set **norms** (when to use AI, when to review, what “good” looks like) and **gather** feedback so **tool** and **process** choices reflect **what the team actually wants**.

### Why is control more important than speed?

**Control** (edit, reject, steer) ensures **correctness** and **ownership**. **Speed** without control can **increase** **rework** and **debt**—see [Trade-offs](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation) and [Impact on code quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

### How do we gather "what developers want" from our team?

**Surveys**, **retros**, and **1:1s**; ask about **context**, **control**, **consistency**, **clarity** and **pain** points. Use feedback to **choose** tools and **set** norms—see [Technical leadership](/blog/technical-leadership-remote-teams).

### What if our tool doesn't support codebase context?

**Paste** or **attach** **relevant** files and **snippets** in **prompts** so the model **sees** **enough** **context**. **Document** **patterns** (e.g. **one** **page** of **layer** and **naming** rules) and **reference** them in **prompts** ("follow the pattern in our README"). **Review** **every** suggestion for **layer** and **style**; **linters** **catch** **mechanical** **drift**. If **multi-file** or **repo-wide** work is **frequent**, **evaluate** a **codebase-aware** tool—see [Cursor vs Claude Code vs Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide).

### Why do some developers resist AI tools?

**Lack of control** (can't edit or reject easily), **wrong** or **irrelevant** suggestions (**context** gap), **no** **explanation** (**clarity** gap), or **inconsistent** output that **adds** **review** churn. **Address** by **choosing** tools that **support** **context**, **control**, **consistency**, and **clarity**—and by **gathering** **feedback** so **norms** and **tool** use **align** with **what** the team **actually** wants. See [How Developers Are Integrating AI](/blog/developers-integrating-ai-daily-workflows).
