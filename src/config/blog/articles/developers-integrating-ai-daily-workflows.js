  content: `## Introduction

**Integrating AI into daily workflows** is no longer about trying a chatbot once—it is about **where** and **how** developers use **completion**, **chat**, **refactors**, **tests**, and **review** every day. This article describes **concrete patterns**: how teams and individuals are weaving AI into **coding**, **review**, **documentation**, and **debugging**, and what **works** vs what **backfires**.

Success depends on **when** you use AI (repetition and scaffolding vs design and security) and **how** you **review** output. Teams that treat AI as a **draft** source and keep **humans** in the loop for **design**, **review**, and **ownership** tend to get **lasting** gains; teams that **over-accept** completion or **skip** review often see **debt** and [productivity plateau](/blog/why-ai-productivity-gains-plateau). We cover **completion** (tab-complete, when to accept), **chat** (explanations, design, debugging), **refactors** (single-file vs multi-file), **tests** and **docs**, and **review**—with links to [The Current State of AI Coding Tools in 2026](/blog/current-state-ai-coding-tools-2026), [Cursor vs Claude Code vs Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide), and [Why AI Productivity Gains Plateau](/blog/why-ai-productivity-gains-plateau).

**Who this is for:** Developers and leads who want **practical** patterns for **where** to use AI in the daily loop and how to **integrate** it without sacrificing [code quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability) or [review](/blog/ai-changing-code-review-testing).

## Decision Context

- **When this applies:** Developers or teams integrating AI into daily workflows (completion, chat, refactors, tests, review) who want practical patterns and norms.
- **When it doesn't:** Readers who only want a tool comparison or who don't use AI yet. This article is about where and how to use AI in the loop and how to review.
- **Scale:** Any team size; the workflows (completion, chat, etc.) and the need for review and norms hold regardless.
- **Constraints:** Success depends on review and norms; without them, integration can increase debt or plateau.
- **Non-goals:** This article doesn't recommend a single tool; it describes workflows and conditions for sustainable use.

## What “integrating AI” means in practice

**Integrating AI** means **routinely** using AI tools as part of **writing**, **reading**, **changing**, and **reviewing** code—not as a one-off. That includes **inline completion** (accept or edit suggestions as you type), **chat** (ask how something works or how to implement X), **multi-step** refactors (e.g. rename, extract, add tests), and **review** assistance (AI-suggested PR comments). Success depends on **when** you use it and **how** you **review** output—see [Trade-Offs of Relying on AI for Code Generation](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation) and [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

**What "routinely" looks like:** **Completion** dozens of times a day for **boilerplate** and **obvious** next lines; **chat** a few times a day for **explanations**, **design** questions, or **debugging**; **refactors** (single or multi-file) when you have a **clear** scope; **test** and **doc** generation for **scaffolding**; **review** tools as a **first pass** on PRs. The **key** is **consistency**—same **review** bar for AI output as for human-written code, and **ownership** for every change that ships.

## AI in daily workflows at a glance

| Workflow | How AI is used | Risk if unchecked |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Completion** | Tab-complete, accept or edit | Over-accepting wrong or brittle code |
| **Chat** | Explain, design, debug | Trusting design or security advice |
| **Refactors** | Single/multi-file edit | Breaking callers or contracts |
| **Tests** | Generate unit/integration tests | Shallow tests, missed edge cases |
| **Docs** | Comments, README, API docs | Stale or wrong docs |
| **Review** | AI-suggested PR comments | Missing design/security issues |

**How to read the table:** Each **workflow** (completion, chat, refactors, tests, docs, review) has a **typical** AI use and a **risk** if you **do not** check output. **Completion** is **highest** volume; **chat** is **second**; **refactors**, **tests**, **docs**, and **review** are more **selective**. The **common** thread: **use** AI for **speed** and **scaffolding**, but **review** and **own** the result so **quality** stays high—see [Impact on code quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

---

## Completion: when and how to use

**Completion** (tab-complete) is the **most common** integration: you type, AI suggests the next line or block. **Use it** for **boilerplate** (DTOs, mappers, getters/setters), **repetitive** patterns ([repository](/blog/repository-pattern-unit-of-work-dotnet) impl, [dependency injection](/blog/dependency-injection-dotnet-core) wiring), **tests** for simple cases (arrange/act/assert scaffold), and **obvious** next steps (closing braces, return statements). **Do not** accept blindly: **read** and **edit**; reject when it **guesses** APIs (wrong method or version), **business rules**, or **edge cases** (e.g. null, empty list) wrong. Fits well with [Clean Architecture](/blog/clean-architecture-dotnet) when you complete **within** one layer so suggestions stay **bounded**. See [What AI IDEs Get Right — and What They Get Wrong](/blog/ai-ides-what-they-get-right-wrong).

**Concrete examples:** **Good:** Accept completion for a **property** list that **matches** your **entity**; **tweak** naming if needed. **Good:** Accept **test** scaffold (mocks, assert) and **add** **edge-case** tests yourself. **Bad:** Accept completion that **calls** an API you do not have (e.g. .NET 7+ in a .NET 6 project — see [Example 2](#example-2-completion--wrong-api-or-framework-version)) or that **violates** your **layering** (e.g. controller calling repository directly — see [Example 1](#example-1-add-a-new-order-api--layer-violation)). **Mitigation:** **Scan** every suggestion; **run** tests and **linters** before commit. For **full** code-level examples of what bad and good look like (exact prompts, full bad output, and full corrected code), see the next section.

---

## Code-level examples: prompts, bad output, and fixes

The following examples show **exact prompts** you might type, **full** **bad** AI output (what the model returns in theory), **what goes wrong** at build or runtime, and **full** **correct** code. Each scenario is **concrete** at **code** level so you can **see** the issues, not just read about them. Use these as **checklists** when **reviewing** AI-generated code and when **writing** prompts so you ask for **bounded** behaviour.

---

### Example 1: "Add a new order API" — layer violation

**Exact prompt (chat or composer):**

> "Add a new API endpoint to create an order. Accept order details in the request body and save to the database."

**What you get in theory (bad AI output):** The model often returns a **single controller** that talks to the database directly. Full example of the **bad** code you might receive:

\`\`\`csharp
// BAD: Full controller as often suggested by AI — controller does too much, no service layer, direct DB
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace MyApp.Api.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class OrderController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly AppDbContext _db;

        public OrderController(AppDbContext db)
        {
            _db = db;
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Create(OrderRequest request)
        {
            var order = new Order
            {
                CustomerId = request.CustomerId,
                Total = request.Total,
                CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow
            };
            _db.Orders.Add(order);
            await _db.SaveChangesAsync();
            return Ok(new { order.Id });
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

**What goes wrong at code level:** The **controller** depends on **AppDbContext** (infrastructure). There is **no** application layer (use case); **validation** and **business rules** are missing or inline. You **cannot** unit-test the create logic without a real DB; changing persistence (e.g. to a message queue) forces controller changes. This **violates** [Clean Architecture](/blog/clean-architecture-dotnet) and makes the codebase harder to maintain. See [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development).

**Correct approach (full good code):** Controller only delegates to an application-layer use case; infrastructure stays in the repository implementation.

\`\`\`csharp
// GOOD: Controller delegates to application layer; no direct DB or infrastructure in API layer
namespace MyApp.Api.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class OrderController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ICreateOrderUseCase _createOrderUseCase;

        public OrderController(ICreateOrderUseCase createOrderUseCase)
        {
            _createOrderUseCase = createOrderUseCase;
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Create(OrderRequest request)
        {
            var result = await _createOrderUseCase.Execute(request);
            return result.Match<IActionResult>(
                id => Ok(new { Id = id }),
                err => BadRequest(new { Error = err })
            );
        }
    }
}

// Application layer — use case uses repository interface only
namespace MyApp.Application.Orders
{
    public interface ICreateOrderUseCase
    {
        Task<Result<Guid>> Execute(OrderRequest request);
    }

    public class CreateOrderUseCase : ICreateOrderUseCase
    {
        private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;

        public CreateOrderUseCase(IOrderRepository orderRepository)
        {
            _orderRepository = orderRepository;
        }

        public async Task<Result<Guid>> Execute(OrderRequest request)
        {
            if (request.CustomerId == Guid.Empty || request.Total < 0)
                return Result<Guid>.Failure("Invalid request");
            var order = new Order(request.CustomerId, request.Total);
            await _orderRepository.AddAsync(order);
            return Result<Guid>.Success(order.Id);
        }
    }
}

// Infrastructure: IOrderRepository implemented with DbContext in a separate project/layer
\`\`\`

**Takeaway:** Either **narrow the prompt** (e.g. "Add a use case for CreateOrder that uses our existing IOrderRepository and a controller that calls it") or **review** and **reject** any controller that touches DbContext or infrastructure directly.

---

### Example 2: Completion — wrong API or framework version

**Context:** You are in a **.NET 6** project. You type something like \`if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(customerName))\` and the IDE suggests the next line, or you ask completion to "add a guard for null or empty name."

**What you get in theory (bad AI output):** Completion may suggest **.NET 7+** APIs that do not exist in .NET 6. Full method as suggested:

\`\`\`csharp
// BAD (in a .NET 6 project): ThrowIfNullOrEmpty is available only in .NET 7+
public void ProcessCustomer(string customerName)
{
    ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(customerName);
    // ... rest of method
}
\`\`\`

**What goes wrong at code level:** **Build** fails with an error such as: \`'ArgumentException' does not contain a definition for 'ThrowIfNullOrEmpty'\`. If the API existed but behaved differently across versions, you could get **runtime** issues in production. So the **result in theory** is a **compile error** and broken CI until you fix it.

**Correct approach (full good code for .NET 6):**

\`\`\`csharp
// GOOD for .NET 6: explicit check, no dependency on .NET 7+ APIs
public void ProcessCustomer(string customerName)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(customerName))
        throw new ArgumentException("Customer name is required.", nameof(customerName));
    // ... rest of method
}
\`\`\`

**Takeaway:** Always **review** imports and API usage; **pin** target framework in the project file; run **build** in CI so version mismatches are caught. See [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development).

---

### Example 3: Chat "fix this query" — SQL injection

**Exact prompt:**

> "Here's my code that builds a SQL query from user input. Fix it so it works with our database."
>
> (Then you paste something like: \`var sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = '" + userInput + "'";\`)

**What you get in theory (bad AI output):** The model may "fix" formatting or small issues but **leave** user input **concatenated** into the SQL string. Full bad example:

\`\`\`csharp
// BAD: User input concatenated into SQL — SQL injection
public async Task<List<User>> FindUsersByName(string userInput)
{
    var sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = '" + userInput.Replace("'", "''") + "'";
    var users = await _db.Users.FromSqlRaw(sql).ToListAsync();
    return users;
}
\`\`\`

**What goes wrong at code level:** An attacker sends \`userInput = "'; DROP TABLE Users; --"\`. The resulting SQL becomes:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = ''; DROP TABLE Users; --'
\`\`\`

The database **executes** both the SELECT and the DROP. So the **result in theory** is **data loss** and **security** breach. Escaping quotes is **not** sufficient; **parameterisation** is required. See [OWASP](/blog/owasp-api-security-top-10) and [Securing APIs](/blog/securing-apis-dotnet).

**Correct approach (full good code):**

\`\`\`csharp
// GOOD: Parameterised query; user input never concatenated into SQL
public async Task<List<User>> FindUsersByName(string userInput)
{
    return await _db.Users
        .FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = {0}", userInput)
        .ToListAsync();
}
// Or use LINQ: _db.Users.Where(u => u.Name == userInput).ToListAsync();
\`\`\`

**Takeaway:** **Never** trust AI for auth, secrets, or injection-prone code. **Human** security review is **required** for any code that touches user input and SQL or shell commands. See [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development).

---

### Example 4: Generated unit test — shallow, no edge cases

**Exact prompt (chat):**

> "Generate unit tests for this method: \`public decimal GetTotal(Order order)\` that sums line items."

**What you get in theory (bad AI output):** Often one test, **happy path** only, with weak or incomplete assertions. Full bad example:

\`\`\`csharp
// BAD: Happy path only; no null/empty; weak assertion
public class GetTotalTests
{
    private readonly OrderCalculator _sut = new OrderCalculator();

    [Fact]
    public void GetTotal_ReturnsSum()
    {
        var order = new Order
        {
            LineItems = new List<LineItem>
            {
                new LineItem { Amount = 10 },
                new LineItem { Amount = 20 }
            }
        };
        var result = _sut.GetTotal(order);
        Assert.NotNull(result);
        Assert.Equal(30, result);
    }
}
\`\`\`

**What goes wrong at code level:** **Production** may pass \`order == null\` or \`order.LineItems == null\` or empty list. The **implementation** might throw \`NullReferenceException\` or return 0; the **tests** do **not** cover these, so you get **false confidence** and bugs in production. The **result in theory** is a **production incident** when a null or empty order is passed. See [How AI Is Changing Code Review and Testing](/blog/ai-changing-code-review-testing) and [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

**Correct approach (full good tests):** Add **edge cases** and **explicit** behaviour assertions.

\`\`\`csharp
// GOOD: Edge cases and behaviour asserted
public class GetTotalTests
{
    private readonly OrderCalculator _sut = new OrderCalculator();

    [Fact]
    public void GetTotal_WhenOrderNull_ThrowsArgumentNullException()
    {
        Assert.Throws<ArgumentNullException>(() => _sut.GetTotal(null));
    }

    [Fact]
    public void GetTotal_WhenLineItemsNull_ThrowsOrReturnsZero_AccordingToSpec()
    {
        var order = new Order { LineItems = null };
        // If spec says throw: Assert.Throws<...>(() => _sut.GetTotal(order));
        // If spec says return 0:
        var result = _sut.GetTotal(order);
        Assert.Equal(0, result);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void GetTotal_WhenLineItemsEmpty_ReturnsZero()
    {
        var order = new Order { LineItems = new List<LineItem>() };
        var result = _sut.GetTotal(order);
        Assert.Equal(0, result);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void GetTotal_WhenLineItemsPresent_ReturnsSum()
    {
        var order = new Order
        {
            LineItems = new List<LineItem>
            {
                new LineItem { Amount = 10 },
                new LineItem { Amount = 20 }
            }
        };
        var result = _sut.GetTotal(order);
        Assert.Equal(30, result);
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Takeaway:** Use AI for **scaffold** only; **add** null, empty, boundary, and business-rule tests yourself; **review** assertion quality. See [Testing strategies](/blog/testing-strategies-unit-integration-e2e).

---

### Example 5: Multi-file refactor — broken caller (missing await)

**Exact prompt (composer/codebase):**

> "Rename \`GetOrderById\` to \`GetOrderAsync\` and make it async; update all callers."

**What you get in theory (bad AI output):** The repository is updated correctly, but **one caller** is missed or not updated. Repository change:

\`\`\`csharp
// New signature in IOrderRepository / OrderRepository
public async Task<Order?> GetOrderAsync(Guid id, CancellationToken ct = default);
\`\`\`

One caller **still** looks like this (bad):

\`\`\`csharp
// BAD: Caller not updated — GetOrderAsync returns Task<Order?>, but caller doesn't await
public async Task<OrderSummary> GetOrderSummary(Guid id)
{
    var order = _orderRepo.GetOrderAsync(id);   // order is Task<Order?>, not Order?
    if (order == null) return null;             // comparison wrong: Task is never null
    return new OrderSummary(order.Total);        // order.Total fails: order is Task, not Order
}
\`\`\`

**What goes wrong at code level:** **Compiler** may error on \`order.Total\` (operator not defined for \`Task<Order?>\`). If you force it (e.g. by ignoring the warning), **runtime** will use a **Task** object where an **Order** is expected and **fail**. So the **result in theory** is **compile** or **runtime** failure in that caller.

**Correct approach (full good code for caller):**

\`\`\`csharp
// GOOD: Caller updated to await
public async Task<OrderSummary?> GetOrderSummary(Guid id)
{
    var order = await _orderRepo.GetOrderAsync(id);
    if (order == null) return null;
    return new OrderSummary(order.Total);
}
\`\`\`

**Takeaway:** For **multi-file** refactors, **review every call site**; run **tests** after applying changes; use **small commits** so you can revert. See [Refactors: single-file and multi-file](#refactors-single-file-and-multi-file).

---

### Example 6: Dependency injection — wrong lifetime (captured dependency)

**Exact prompt (chat):**

> "Register our services in DI. We have OrderService, PaymentService, and EmailSender."

**What you get in theory (bad AI output):** All services registered as **Singleton** or **Scoped** in a way that **captures** a scoped dependency in a singleton. Full bad example:

\`\`\`csharp
// BAD: OrderService is Singleton but depends on DbContext (Scoped) — captured dependency
services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options => ..., ServiceLifetime.Scoped);
services.AddSingleton<OrderService>();  // OrderService takes AppDbContext in ctor
services.AddScoped<PaymentService>();
\`\`\`

**What goes wrong at code level:** At **runtime**, the first request creates the singleton \`OrderService\` with one \`AppDbContext\`. Every later request **reuses** that same DbContext, leading to **stale data**, **concurrency** bugs, or **disposed context** exceptions. The **result in theory** is **incorrect behaviour** or **runtime errors** under load.

**Correct approach (full good code):**

\`\`\`csharp
// GOOD: Services that use DbContext must be Scoped (or Transient), not Singleton
services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options => ..., ServiceLifetime.Scoped);
services.AddScoped<OrderService>();
services.AddScoped<PaymentService>();
services.AddSingleton<IEmailSender, EmailSender>();  // Only if EmailSender is stateless/thread-safe
\`\`\`

**Takeaway:** **Review** DI registrations for **lifetime** mismatches; do not accept "register everything as Singleton" from AI. See [Dependency injection](/blog/dependency-injection-dotnet-core) and [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development).

---

### Example 7: Nullable and edge case — compiles but fails at runtime

**Exact prompt (completion or chat):**

> "Add a method that returns the first line item's product name from an order."

**What you get in theory (bad AI output):** Code that **compiles** but **does not** handle null or empty collections. Full bad example:

\`\`\`csharp
// BAD: No null/empty checks — NullReferenceException or InvalidOperationException at runtime
public string GetFirstLineItemProductName(Order order)
{
    return order.LineItems.First().ProductName;
}
\`\`\`

**What goes wrong at code level:** If \`order\` is null, \`order.LineItems\` throws \`NullReferenceException\`. If \`LineItems\` is empty, \`.First()\` throws \`InvalidOperationException\`. So the **result in theory** is **runtime crashes** in production when orders are empty or partially loaded.

**Correct approach (full good code):**

\`\`\`csharp
// GOOD: Explicit null and empty handling
public string? GetFirstLineItemProductName(Order? order)
{
    if (order?.LineItems == null || !order.LineItems.Any())
        return null;
    return order.LineItems.First().ProductName;
}
\`\`\`

**Takeaway:** **Always** consider null and empty in prompts or review; add **tests** for these cases. See [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development) (Edge cases).

---

### Summary: use these examples in review

When **reviewing** AI-generated code, **check**: (1) **Layers** — no controller → DB or infrastructure in the wrong place. (2) **API version** — methods and types exist in your target framework. (3) **Security** — no concatenated user input in SQL or commands; use parameterised or safe APIs. (4) **Tests** — edge cases and assertions that verify behaviour, not just "it runs." (5) **Refactors** — all callers updated and tests pass. (6) **DI** — correct lifetimes, no captured scoped dependencies in singletons. (7) **Null/empty** — explicit handling or documented contracts. Use the **exact prompts** and **full bad/good** pairs above as **templates** for what to look for. See [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability) and [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development).

---

## Chat: explanations, design, debugging

**Chat** is used for **“how does this work?”**, **“how do I implement X?”**, and **“why is this failing?”**. **Use it** for **learning**, **exploration**, and **first drafts** of design. **Do not** treat chat as **authoritative** for **architecture**, **security**, or **performance**—always **verify**. [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development) applies here. [What Developers Actually Want From AI Assistants](/blog/what-developers-want-from-ai-assistants) emphasises **context** and **control**; give the model **enough** context (file, error, constraints) and **keep control** of final decisions.

---

## Refactors: single-file and multi-file

**Refactors** range from **rename** and **extract method** to **multi-file** changes (e.g. change signature everywhere). **Single-file** refactors are **safer**—the model **sees** one file and you **review** one diff. **Multi-file** (e.g. Cursor composer, or chat with codebase context) can be **powerful** but **review** every **call site** and **run tests**; **wrong** assumptions about **callers** or **contracts** can **break** integration. Use **version control** and **small commits** so you can **revert**; **run tests** after each **logical** step. See [How AI Is Changing Code Review and Testing](/blog/ai-changing-code-review-testing)—review still catches refactor bugs.

**Patterns that work:** **Rename** or **extract** in **one** file first; **commit**; then **propagate** to **callers** in **small** steps. For **multi-file** "change this pattern everywhere," use a **codebase-aware** tool (e.g. [Cursor](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide)) and **apply** in **chunks** (e.g. one module at a time) with **tests** after each chunk. **Avoid:** One **giant** multi-file change without **intermediate** runs of the **test suite**.

---

## Tests and documentation

AI can **generate** unit tests, integration tests, and **docs** (comments, README, API docs). **Use it** for **scaffolding** (arrange/act/assert, mocks) and **obvious** cases; **expand** and **tune** tests for **edge cases** (null, empty, boundaries) and **business rules**. [Testing strategies](/blog/testing-strategies-unit-integration-e2e) still apply: **unit**, **integration**, **e2e** where needed. **Docs** generated by AI can go **stale**—**own** them like any other artifact and **update** when **code** changes. [Trade-offs of AI code generation](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation) include **debt** if generated tests are **shallow** (happy path only) and **never** extended.

**What to add after AI-generated tests:** **Edge cases** (null input, empty list, invalid state); **business** logic (e.g. "when order is cancelled, expect X"); **integration** points (e.g. DB, HTTP) if you use **integration** tests. **Docs:** Use AI for **first draft** of **README** or **comments**; **verify** accuracy and **keep** in sync with **code**.

---

## Code review and PRs

**AI-assisted review** (e.g. Copilot for PRs, or chat “review this diff”) can suggest **style**, **bugs**, and **tests**. **Integrate** it as a **first pass**; **humans** must still check **design**, **security**, and **consistency**. See [How AI Is Changing Code Review and Testing](/blog/ai-changing-code-review-testing). [Technical leadership](/blog/technical-leadership-remote-teams) can set **norms**: e.g. “AI suggestions are optional; human review is required.”

---

## Completion and chat in depth

**Completion:** **Volume**—many developers **accept** or **edit** **dozens** of completions per day (boilerplate, [repository](/blog/repository-pattern-unit-of-work-dotnet), [DI](/blog/dependency-injection-dotnet-core), tests). **Risk** rises when **accept** **without** **reading** (wrong API, wrong layer, missing edge case). **Mitigation:** **Scan** every suggestion; **run** **linters** and **tests**; **reject** or **heavily** **edit** for **security**, **business** rules, **architecture**. **When it backfires:** Wrong **API/version** (build fails)—**review** imports, **pin** versions. **Layer** violation (controller calling repo directly)—**review** for [Clean Architecture](/blog/clean-architecture-dotnet). **Missing edge case** (null, empty)—**add** tests and **review**. See [What AI IDEs Get Right and Wrong](/blog/ai-ides-what-they-get-right-wrong) and [Where AI Still Fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development). **Chat:** **Trust with verification:** explanations, first drafts, single-file refactors—**run** tests and **review**. **Verify, do not trust blindly:** **architecture**, **security**, **performance**, **concurrency**, **business** rules—use [OWASP](/blog/owasp-api-security-top-10), **domain** experts, **tests**. **Give context:** **specific** prompts and **enough** code/error so the model **sees** your problem. See [Trade-Offs](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation) and [What Developers Want From AI](/blog/what-developers-want-from-ai-assistants). **Day-in-the-life:** **Completion** and **chat** are **routine**; **review** and **ownership** (human) are **non-negotiable**. **Same bar** for AI and human code; **metrics** (defect rate, time to change) **apply**; **norms** set **when** to use AI and **when** to **review**. See [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability) and [How AI Is Changing Code Review and Testing](/blog/ai-changing-code-review-testing). **Related:** [Current State of AI Coding Tools](/blog/current-state-ai-coding-tools-2026), [Cursor vs Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide), [Why AI Productivity Gains Plateau](/blog/why-ai-productivity-gains-plateau).

---

## By role: solo, pair, lead

**Solo developer.** **Completion** and **chat** are **primary**; **self-review** (read every suggestion, run tests and linters) is **critical**—no **second** pair of eyes. **Document** **patterns** and **norms** so **consistency** holds; **measure** **defect** rate and **time to change** so **quality** is **visible**. **Pair or mob.** **Driver** uses **completion**/chat; **navigator** **reviews** **suggestions** and **catches** **layer** or **security** issues. **Ownership** is **shared** but **explicit**. **Tech lead or architect.** **Set** **norms** (when to use AI, when to review, what "done" means); **review** for **architecture** and **consistency**; **measure** **outcomes** so **plateau** or **debt** is **caught** early. See [Technical Leadership in Remote Teams](/blog/technical-leadership-remote-teams) and [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

---

## Tools that support each workflow

**Completion:** [GitHub Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide), **Cursor**, **Claude Code**—**inline** tab-complete; **strong** for **boilerplate** and **obvious** next lines. **Chat:** **Cursor**, **Claude Code**, **Copilot Chat**—**explanations**, **first** drafts, **refactor** suggestions; **codebase** context (e.g. Cursor **@codebase**) **improves** **relevance** for **multi-file** work. **Refactors (multi-file):** **Cursor** **composer** or **codebase-aware** chat—**review** every file and **run** tests. **Tests:** **Completion** or **chat** for **scaffolds**; **expand** for **edge** cases and **business** rules—see [How AI Is Changing Code Review and Testing](/blog/ai-changing-code-review-testing). **Review:** **Copilot for PRs** or **chat** "review this diff"—**first** pass only; **human** approval **required**. See [Current State of AI Coding Tools](/blog/current-state-ai-coding-tools-2026) and [Cursor vs Claude Code vs Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide).

## Summary table: workflow by task and risk

| Task | Use AI for | You still do | Risk if unchecked |
|------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Boilerplate** | Completion | Read, edit, review | Wrong API, wrong layer |
| **Explain code** | Chat | Verify, extend | Wrong or incomplete explanation |
| **Debug** | Chat (error + code) | Verify fix, test | Wrong assumption, security |
| **Refactor one file** | Chat or completion | Review, run tests | Broken behaviour |
| **Refactor many files** | Codebase-aware tool | Review every call site, tests | Broken callers, drift |
| **Unit tests** | Generate scaffold | Add edge cases, business rules | Shallow tests, false confidence |
| **Docs** | First draft | Own, keep in sync | Stale or wrong |
| **PR review** | First-pass suggestions | Design, security, consistency | Missing design/security |

---

## Key terms

- **Completion (inline):** **Tab-complete** or **suggestion** as you type; **most** **common** daily use; **review** every suggestion.
- **Chat:** **Conversation** with the model (explain, draft, refactor); **give** **context** (file, error) and **verify** **design**/security advice.
- **Scaffolding:** **First-draft** structure (e.g. test arrange/act/assert, DTOs); **expand** and **tune** for **edge** cases and **ownership**.

---

## Real-world scenarios

Each scenario below maps to **code-level** issues you can see in the [Code-level examples](#code-level-examples-prompts-bad-output-and-fixes) section (layer violation, wrong API, injection, shallow tests, broken refactor, DI lifetime, null/empty). Use them to recognise when the same failure mode appears in your codebase.

**Scenario 1: Developer leans on completion for a feature.** They accept many completions for DTOs, mappers, and controller wiring. In review, one wrong property type (e.g. wrong API version as in Example 2) and a missing null check (as in Example 7) are found. **Takeaway:** Scan every suggestion; run tests and linter before pushing. Completion speeds typing but does not replace review. The **exact** failure mode is visible in the bad/good code pairs in Example 2 and Example 7.

**Scenario 2: Team uses chat for a refactor.** They ask "extract this into a service and update callers." The model suggests a split; they apply it across several files. One caller passes a different shape or forgets to await (as in Example 5) and breaks at runtime. **Takeaway:** Multi-file refactors need review of every call site and tests after apply. Use small steps when possible. See the **full** broken caller and corrected caller in Example 5.

**Scenario 3: AI-generated tests pass but miss edge cases.** The team generates unit tests for a service; happy path is covered (as in the bad test in Example 4). A production bug appears for null input. **Takeaway:** Use AI for scaffold; add edge-case and business-rule tests manually. The **full** bad vs good test suite in Example 4 shows what to add (null, empty, behaviour assertions). See [Testing strategies](/blog/testing-strategies-unit-integration-e2e) and [Trade-offs](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation).

**Scenario 4: PR review tool suggests many comments.** The team uses Copilot for PRs; it suggests style and obvious fixes. Reviewers adopt some and reject others; design and security are still human-checked. **Takeaway:** AI first pass is useful; humans own final approval and design/security. Security-sensitive changes (e.g. any SQL or auth) should be checked against Example 3-style injection and layer issues from Example 1.

**Scenario 5: New service is slow or throws under load.** After adding a "cache" or "background job" suggested by chat, the team registers it in DI. They accepted the default registration and now a scoped DbContext is captured by a singleton (Example 6). **Takeaway:** Review DI lifetimes for every new service; see the full bad vs good registration in Example 6.

---

## Common issues and challenges

- **Over-accepting completion:** Accepting every suggestion without **reading** leads to **wrong** APIs and **brittle** code. Always **scan** and **edit** before commit—see [Impact on code quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).
- **Using chat for architecture:** AI can suggest **plausible** but **wrong** design. Use chat for **exploration** and **drafts**; **own** architecture and verify—see [Where AI still fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development).
- **Multi-file refactors without review:** Large edits can **break** call sites or **drift** in style. **Review** every file; use **small** commits and **tests**—see [How AI Is Changing Code Review and Testing](/blog/ai-changing-code-review-testing).
- **Shallow generated tests:** AI often generates **happy path** tests; **edge cases** and **business rules** need human input. **Fix:** Expand and **tune**; add **null**, **empty**, **boundary**, and **domain** tests—see [Testing strategies](/blog/testing-strategies-unit-integration-e2e) and [Trade-offs](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation).
- **Stale or wrong docs:** AI-generated **comments** or **README** can **drift** from code. **Fix:** Treat docs as **owned** artifacts; **update** when **code** changes; **review** AI-generated docs like any other content.

## Best practices and pitfalls

**Do:**

- Use AI for **repetition** and **scaffolding** (boilerplate, tests, docs); **review** all output.
- Keep **tests** and **architecture** clear ([Clean Architecture](/blog/clean-architecture-dotnet), [testing strategies](/blog/testing-strategies-unit-integration-e2e)); align with [what developers want](/blog/what-developers-want-from-ai-assistants).
- Use **small steps** for refactors; **run tests** after multi-file changes.
- Expect [productivity plateau](/blog/why-ai-productivity-gains-plateau) and invest in **quality** and **review**.

**Do not:**

- Trust AI for **security** or **architecture** without verification.
- **Accept** completion without **reading**; let **generated tests** replace **thinking** about edge cases.
- Skip **human review** for PRs or **critical** paths.

## Norms and team integration

Set **norms** so AI use is **consistent** and **review** is non-negotiable. Examples: **"All code (human or AI) requires review before merge"**; **"Use AI for boilerplate and scaffolding; design and security stay human-led"**; **"Do not paste secrets or PII into chat"**. [Technical leadership](/blog/technical-leadership-remote-teams) can **pilot** with one **squad**, **gather** feedback ([what developers want](/blog/what-developers-want-from-ai-assistants)), and **roll out** with **clear** expectations. **Measure** outcomes (defect rate, cycle time) so you can **tune** norms and **tool** use—see [Why AI Productivity Gains Plateau](/blog/why-ai-productivity-gains-plateau).

## Quick reference: workflow by task

| Task | Use AI for | You still do |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Boilerplate** (DTOs, mappers) | Completion | Read, edit, review |
| **Explain code** | Chat (paste block) | Verify, extend |
| **Debug** | Chat (paste error + code) | Verify fix, test |
| **Refactor one file** | Chat or completion | Review, run tests |
| **Refactor many files** | Codebase-aware tool | Review every call site, tests |
| **Unit tests** | Generate scaffold | Add edge cases, business rules |
| **Docs** | First draft | Own, keep in sync |
| **PR review** | First-pass suggestions | Design, security, consistency |

## Summary

Developers integrate AI into **completion**, **chat**, **refactors**, **tests**, **docs**, and **review**; **success** depends on **when** you use it (repetition and scaffolding) and **how** you **review** (always, with ownership). Use [Current State of AI Coding Tools](/blog/current-state-ai-coding-tools-2026) and [Cursor vs Copilot vs Claude Code](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide) to choose tools; use [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability) and [Trade-Offs](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation) to keep quality high. Set **norms** and **measure** outcomes so integration stays **sustainable** and [productivity plateau](/blog/why-ai-productivity-gains-plateau) and **quality** drift are **addressed**.

## Position & Rationale

The article describes where developers use AI in the daily loop (completion, chat, refactors, tests, docs, review) and states that success depends on when you use it and how you review. The stance is factual: use AI for repetition and scaffolding; review everything; set norms and measure outcomes. It doesn't claim that integrating AI always increases productivity—it ties outcome to review and norms.

## Trade-Offs & Failure Modes

Using AI in more places (e.g. refactors, tests) can speed first drafts but adds the risk of brittle or wrong output if review is skipped. Tightening norms (review required, ownership) reduces that risk but doesn't remove it. Failure modes: over-accepting completion without reading; using chat for design or security decisions without verification; skipping review because "we're going fast."

## What Most Guides Miss

Many guides list workflows (completion, chat) but don't tie them to **risk** (when to use vs when not) or to **norms** (who approves, what must be human-only). Another gap: **diversifying use**—tests, review, explanations, not just completion—can sustain gains; that's underplayed compared to "use completion everywhere." The bit they skip: **integration is a team decision.** One developer using AI in a corner is fine until their code hits review and nobody knows the assumptions; once you scale, you need agreed boundaries (e.g. "we use AI for boilerplate and tests, not for auth or billing logic") and someone who owns the rollout. Most posts don't say who decides or what happens when two people disagree on "is this AI-appropriate."

## Decision Framework

- **If you're starting** → Use completion for boilerplate; review every suggestion; then add chat for explanations and single-file refactors.
- **If you're adding refactors or tests** → Keep scope clear; review output; expand tests for edge cases.
- **For any workflow** → Set norms (when review is required, who owns what); measure outcomes (defect rate, time to change).
- **If quality or plateau is a concern** → Tighten review and standards; diversify use rather than adding more completion.

## Key Takeaways

- AI in daily workflows: completion, chat, refactors, tests, docs, review; success depends on when you use it and how you review.
- Use for repetition and scaffolding; review and own everything; set norms and measure outcomes.
- Diversifying use (not just completion) and keeping review mandatory sustain gains.

## When I Would Use This Again — and When I Wouldn't

Use this framing when a team is integrating AI into daily work and needs practical patterns and norms. Don't use it to claim that "more AI" always helps; the article states that review and norms determine outcome.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where do developers use AI most in daily workflow?

**Completion** (tab-complete) is the most common; **chat** for explanations and design is second. **Refactors**, **tests**, and **review** are used more selectively.

### Does integrating AI always increase productivity?

Not always. Initial gains are common; [Why AI Productivity Gains Plateau After the First Month](/blog/why-ai-productivity-gains-plateau) explains why gains can level off. Quality and review matter.

### How do I use AI for refactors safely?

Use **small steps**, **review** every change, **run tests** after multi-file refactors, and keep **version control** so you can revert. See [How AI Is Changing Code Review and Testing](/blog/ai-changing-code-review-testing).

### Should I use AI for tests and documentation?

Yes for **scaffolding** and **obvious** cases; **expand** and **tune** for edge cases and business rules. See [Testing strategies](/blog/testing-strategies-unit-integration-e2e) and [Trade-Offs of AI code generation](/blog/trade-offs-ai-code-generation).

### What do developers want when integrating AI?

See [What Developers Actually Want From AI Assistants](/blog/what-developers-want-from-ai-assistants): context, control, consistency, clarity.

### How does AI fit with code review?

AI can **suggest** comments; **humans** must still own **design**, **security**, and **consistency**. See [How AI Is Changing Code Review and Testing](/blog/ai-changing-code-review-testing).

### What is the first AI workflow I should try?

Start with **completion** (tab-complete): use it for **boilerplate** and **obvious** next lines; **read** and **edit** every suggestion. Then add **chat** for **explanations** ("what does this do?") and **refactors** in one file. See [Current State of AI Coding Tools](/blog/current-state-ai-coding-tools-2026).

### How do I avoid productivity plateau with AI?

**Diversify** use (completion, chat, tests, review); set **standards** and **review** so quality does not slip; measure **outcomes** (shipped value, defects). See [Why AI Productivity Gains Plateau](/blog/why-ai-productivity-gains-plateau) and [Impact on code quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability).

### Should I use AI for debugging?

Yes for **first pass**: paste **error** and **context** and ask "why might this fail?" or "suggest a fix." **Verify** the answer (wrong assumptions, security); do not run suggested code blindly. See [Where AI still fails](/blog/where-ai-fails-real-world-software-development).

### How do I integrate AI into our team workflow?

Set **norms** ([technical leadership](/blog/technical-leadership-remote-teams)): when to use AI, when **review** is required, what "done" means. Pilot with one **squad**; gather feedback; align with [what developers want](/blog/what-developers-want-from-ai-assistants).

### Which tools fit which workflow best?

**Completion:** Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code (inline). **Chat and codebase-wide:** Cursor (@codebase, composer), Claude Code, Copilot Chat. **Multi-file refactors:** Cursor composer or codebase-aware chat. **PR review:** Copilot for PRs or chat "review this diff." See [Tools that support each workflow](#tools-that-support-each-workflow) and [Cursor vs Claude Code vs Copilot](/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-vs-copilot-ai-ide).

### How do solo developers maintain quality with AI?

**Self-review** every suggestion (layer, API, security); **run** **linters** and **tests** before commit; **document** **patterns** so **consistency** holds; **measure** **defect** rate and **time to change** so **quality** is **visible**. **Do not** skip **review** because you're **solo**—see [Impact on Code Quality](/blog/impact-ai-tools-code-quality-maintainability) and [By role: solo, pair, lead](#by-role-solo-pair-lead).
