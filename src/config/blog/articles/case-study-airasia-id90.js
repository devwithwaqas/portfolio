  content: `## Introduction

This guidance is relevant when the topic of this article applies to your system or design choices; it breaks down when constraints or context differ. I've applied it in real projects and refined the takeaways over time (as of 2026).

The **AirAsia ID90** portal is an **employee benefits** platform that gives staff access to **90% discounted flights** within the **critical 60-minute departure window**—turning unsold seats into employee satisfaction. This case study walks through the **goals**, **architecture**, **tech stack**, **engineering challenges**, and **business outcomes** from delivering the system: a **mission-critical .NET Core** application processing **over 3,000 daily transactions** with **99.9% uptime**, **real-time flight monitoring**, **automated discount application**, **comprehensive refund management**, and **advanced analytics** powered by machine learning. The platform integrates with **12+ legacy AirAsia systems**, uses **Google SSO** for authentication, and is deployed on **Azure** with **Azure Service Bus** messaging. Employee-facing portals often get less design and engineering attention than customer apps—but they need the same care: **performance**, **clarity**, and **support** so that staff trust and use the product.

If you are planning or running a similar internal portal—employee benefits, airline integration, or high-volume booking—the patterns and trade-offs below will help. The article stays factual: what was built, what was solved, and what was measured.

## Decision Context

- **System scale:** Employee portal with 3,000+ daily transactions, 99.9% uptime, 60-minute booking window; integration with 12+ legacy AirAsia systems (flight ops, crew, revenue, customer service); real-time flight data and ML for seat allocation.
- **Team size:** Cross-functional (backend .NET, front end Angular, integration, ops); ownership split between ID90 engine, API, and legacy adapters.
- **Time / budget pressure:** Fixed timeline; delivery required phased integration and zero-downtime deployments; Google SSO and Azure hosting.
- **Technical constraints:** .NET Core API, Angular SPA, Azure (App Service, Service Bus, SQL, Redis); 12+ legacy system APIs with fixed contracts.
- **Non-goals:** This case study does not optimize for consumer-scale marketing sites or for greenfield-only; it optimises for employee-facing, high-volume booking with legacy integration and reliability.


## What was the project?

The **AirAsia ID90** portal is an **employee benefits** platform for **ID90** (industry discount) flight bookings. **ID90** is a common industry program that gives airline employees **discounted standby or confirmed travel**. The project delivered a **single place** for AirAsia employees to access **90% discounted flights** within the **60-minute departure window**: **real-time flight data** integration to identify available seats, **automated discount application**, **instant booking** and **refund workflow**, and **secure auth** (Google SSO) so that only authorised employees could use the system. The platform had to integrate with **12+ legacy AirAsia systems** (flight operations, crew management, revenue management, customer service), handle **3,000+ daily bookings** during peak periods, and provide **advanced analytics** and **machine learning** for booking pattern prediction and seat allocation optimisation—with **enterprise-scale** reliability and **zero-downtime** deployments.

## The Challenge

AirAsia faced a significant challenge with **unsold seats** on flights departing within the hour. These seats represented **lost revenue** opportunities, while employees often needed **last-minute travel** but could not afford full-price tickets. The airline needed a system that could **dynamically manage** discounted bookings while maintaining **operational efficiency** and **preventing abuse**. Requirements included: **real-time flight data** integration to identify availability in the **60-minute window**; **automated 90% discount** application for eligible employees; **instant booking** and **refund** workflow with **full audit trails**; **secure authentication** (Google SSO) and **role-based** access; **mobile-responsive** design for booking from any device; **integration with 12+ legacy AirAsia systems** (flight operations, crew management, revenue management, customer service) with **real-time sync**, **API rate limits**, and **data consistency** across heterogeneous systems; and **advanced analytics** and **machine learning** for booking patterns and seat allocation—all while processing **3,000+** concurrent bookings during peak seasons with **sub-second** response times and **zero** double-booking or conflicts.

---

## The Solution

The **ID90 Portal** leverages **real-time flight data** integration to identify available seats within the **60-minute departure window**. The system **automatically applies 90% discounts** to eligible employees, **processes bookings instantly**, and manages the **entire refund workflow**. Built on **.NET Core** with **Angular** frontend, the platform integrates with AirAsia's existing reservation systems through **Azure Service Bus** messaging. **Key technical choices:** **Azure App Service** for hosting; **Azure SQL** for transactional data; **Redis** caching for **real-time performance** (98% hit rate); **CI/CD** with **Azure DevOps** for **zero-downtime** deployments; **Application Insights** for monitoring and **anomaly detection**; **machine learning** models for booking pattern prediction and seat allocation optimisation. **Eligibility** is enforced in the API: the backend resolves the user from the token, checks **tenure**, **department**, and **employment status** against business rules, and only then applies the discount and calls the airline integration—keeping the logic **secure** and **auditable**.

---

---

## Outcomes and lessons

**Outcomes:** The portal went live with **secure auth** (Google SSO), **clear eligibility** logic in the API, **real-time** integration with **12+** AirAsia systems, and a **simple, performant** booking flow. **99.9%** uptime during peak travel seasons; **3,000+** daily bookings with **90%** discount calculations in real time; **$15M+** annual employee savings; **95%** refund automation. **Adoption** was sustained by **performance**, **clarity**, and **support**.

**Lessons:** **Internal portals need the same care as customer apps**: performance, clarity, and support drive trust and adoption. **Encapsulate integration in the backend** so that security and business rules are enforced in one place. **Real-time and caching** (Redis, read replicas, cache invalidation) are critical for sub-second booking. **ML and analytics** (booking patterns, demand forecasting) add value when integrated without impacting real-time operations. **Multi-jurisdiction compliance** (GDPR, PDPA, aviation) and **audit** (7-year retention) must be designed in from day one.

---

## Best practices and takeaways

- **Eligibility in the backend:** Never trust the front end for eligibility; enforce in the API so that rules are secure and auditable.
- **Real-time and caching:** Use **Redis** and **read replicas** with **smart TTLs** (flight 30s, pricing 5min, preferences 1h); **distributed locking** for high-concurrency booking.
- **Integration encapsulation:** Keep **12+** airline/system calls in the backend; **normalise** and **cache** so that the front end stays simple and responsive.
- **Security by default:** **Google SSO**, **JWT**, **MFA**; **HTTPS** only; **PII** encrypted; **rate limiting** and **security headers**; **Key Vault** and **key rotation**.
- **Observability and MLOps:** **Application Insights** with custom telemetry; **distributed tracing**; **ML** models with **MLOps** (retrain, A/B test, rollback) so that analytics do not block booking.

---
---

## Position & Rationale

With hindsight I'd keep **eligibility enforced in the backend** and **real-time integration encapsulated** behind the API—never trust the client for discount rules or expose 12+ systems to the front end. I'd keep **Redis and read replicas** with smart TTLs and **distributed locking** for high-concurrency booking. I'd do the same on **Google SSO**, **JWT**, **security headers**, and **Key Vault**. I'd invest again in **observability** and **MLOps** so analytics and ML don't block booking. What I'd do differently: even earlier **idempotency** and **reconciliation** on every external call; clearer **contracts** with each airline/system so changes don't cascade. I'd avoid treating "real-time" as "no caching"—the right cache boundaries (flight 30s, pricing 5min) made the difference between responsive and overloaded.

---

## Trade-Offs & Failure Modes

- **What we sacrificed:** Simplicity—many moving parts (Service Bus, Redis, 12+ integrations, ML). Operational cost for multi-region, WAF, and MLOps. Some flexibility in discount rules in exchange for abuse prevention and audit.
- **Where it degrades:** If one legacy system is down or slow, we had to fail gracefully and retry; without idempotency and reconciliation we'd have double bookings or inconsistent state. If caching is wrong (too long or too short), we get stale prices or overload.
- **How it fails when misapplied:** Replicating this for a small internal travel tool—overkill. Skipping eligibility checks in the API—abuse. Exposing all integrations to the front end—latency and coupling. No distributed locking—race conditions on last seats.
- **Early warning signs:** "We can't prove who was eligible"; "one airline API is bringing down the portal"; "refunds are manual again"; "we don't know why booking failed."

---

## What Most Guides Miss

Case studies often list architecture but skip **failure handling** and **idempotency**. With 12+ systems and real-time booking, every call can retry or duplicate—we had to design for at-least-once and idempotent handling everywhere. **Reconciliation** with TDP schemes and external systems is underplayed; without it you can't detect or fix drift. **Cache boundaries** (what to cache, for how long, when to invalidate) and **distributed locking** for high-concurrency seats are rarely discussed in employee-portal posts; they were critical for ID90.

---

## Decision Framework

- **If you're building a similar employee-benefits or last-minute booking platform** → Enforce eligibility and discount in the API; encapsulate integrations; use caching and locking for concurrency; design for idempotency and reconciliation.
- **If you have many external systems** → Normalise and cache; don't expose all of them to the client; use event-driven and async where appropriate.
- **If scale and real-time matter** → Redis, read replicas, smart TTLs; distributed locking for scarce resources; observability and tracing.
- **If the context is different** (e.g. B2C, different compliance, no ML) → Reuse patterns (auth, rate limit, security headers, idempotency) but simplify orchestration and integrations.
- **If you can't own compliance and security** → Don't launch without eligibility enforcement, audit, and Key Vault; the risk is too high.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Enforce eligibility and discount in the backend; encapsulate integrations; cache and lock for real-time concurrency; idempotency and reconciliation on every external call.
- Security and observability from day one; MLOps so analytics don't block booking. Reuse these patterns for similar scale and domain; simplify when context is different.

## When I Would Use This Again — and When I Wouldn't

I would use this approach again when I'm building or advising on an employee-facing portal with high-volume transactions and multiple legacy system integrations (flight, HR, booking, etc.). I wouldn't use it for a simple internal tool with one or two APIs—then a lighter stack is enough. I also wouldn't use it when the organisation can't commit to ownership of adapters and to health monitoring; without that, integration becomes a black box. Alternative: if you're only integrating 2–3 systems, consider a single API layer with caching and retry before adding Service Bus and full observability; scale the pattern as you add systems.
